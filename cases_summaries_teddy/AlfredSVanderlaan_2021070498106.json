    "CustomerSummary": "Customer A is a senior investor with moderate risk tolerance, an annual income of $80,000, and a liquid net worth of $912,000. The customer's investment objective was growth and income, explicitly not including speculation. In August 2020, Vanderlaan recommended a $50,000 investment in GWG L Bonds (speculative, unrated corporate bonds), despite knowing Customer A had already invested $135,000 in other alternative investments. This recommendation resulted in Customer A having $185,000 invested in alternative investments, exceeding 20% of his liquid net worth. The Care Obligation violation occurred because the recommendation was not in Customer A's best interest based on his investment profile, particularly his moderate risk tolerance, given the high degree of risk associated with GWG L Bonds. Vanderlaan received $2,000 in commission for this recommendation."

    "CustomerSummary": "Customer B had a moderate risk tolerance, an annual income of $700,000, and a liquid net worth of $1 million. The customer's investment objective was growth and income, not including speculation. In December 2020, knowing Customer B had already invested $100,000 in GWG L Bonds and $15,000 in other alternative investments, Vanderlaan recommended an additional $100,000 investment in GWG L Bonds, receiving $3,920 in commission. In February 2021, with the customer already having invested $200,000 in GWG L Bonds and $15,000 in other alternative investments, Vanderlaan recommended an additional $15,000 investment in L Bonds, receiving $588 in commission. These recommendations resulted in Customer B having over 21% of his liquid net worth invested in L Bonds and 23% in alternative investments overall. The Care Obligation violation occurred because these recommendations were not in Customer B's best interest based on his investment profile, particularly his moderate risk tolerance, given the high degree of risk associated with the L Bonds."

    "OverallSummary": "This case involves Care Obligation violations by Alfred S. Vanderlaan under Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) Rule 15l-1(a)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and FINRA Rule 2010. Vanderlaan recommended GWG L Bonds, which were speculative, unrated corporate bonds with a high degree of risk, to two retail customers whose investment profiles made these recommendations unsuitable. The analytical steps to determine these violations were: (1) Evaluation of customers' investment profiles, including risk tolerance (both moderate), investment objectives (both growth and income, not speculation), and liquid net worth; (2) Assessment of concentration risk created by the recommendations (Customer A: exceeded 20% of liquid net worth in alternative investments; Customer B: over 21% in L Bonds and 23% in alternative investments); (3) Analysis of the investment's characteristics (speculative, unrated corporate bonds with high degree of risk, illiquidity, and only suitable for persons with substantial financial resources and no need for liquidity); (4) Determination that recommendations were not in customers' best interests based on these factors. The violations affected two customers with investments totaling $165,000 ($50,000 for Customer A and $115,000 for Customer B). Vanderlaan received $6,508 in commissions from these recommendations. In January 2022, GWG defaulted on its obligations to L Bond investors and suspended further sales. In April 2022, GWG filed for bankruptcy. Vanderlaan was ordered to pay $6,508 in restitution (equal to his commissions) plus interest, received a $10,000 fine, and a three-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all capacities."
