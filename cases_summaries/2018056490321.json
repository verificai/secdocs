  "OverallSummary": "Between June 30, 2020, and November 2021, Christopher P. Gallo engaged in excessive trading in two retail customers' accounts, including one senior customer. Gallo recommended excessive transactions that resulted in high turnover rates (14-16) and cost-to-equity ratios (64%-80%). For Customer A, a 54-year-old retiree with a speculation investment objective, Gallo recommended 45 transactions that generated $28,428 in commissions while causing $95,393 in realized losses. For Customer B, a 73-year-old with a speculation investment objective, Gallo recommended 120 transactions that generated $69,553 in commissions while causing $109,099 in realized losses. Gallo's actions were found to be excessive and not in the best interest of his customers, willfully violating Regulation Best Interest and FINRA Rule 2010."
