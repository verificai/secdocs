  "Overall summary": "George Apolonides (also known as George Apollo) excessively traded four customers' accounts (including three senior customers) between March 2016 and April 2022. His trading resulted in extremely high turnover rates (17 to 38) and cost-to-equity ratios (71% to 125%), generating $618,911 in total trading costs (including $563,263 in commissions) while causing $735,376 in realized losses. For example, he recommended 357 transactions in a 69-year-old physician's account, resulting in an annualized turnover rate of 31 and a cost-to-equity ratio of 114%, generating $229,352 in trading costs while causing $326,684 in realized losses. In another case, he recommended 127 transactions in a 79-year-old semi-retired banker's account. Apolonides exercised de facto control over the accounts as customers relied on and routinely followed his recommendations. The level of trading was found to be excessive, unsuitable, and not in the customers' best interests. Apolonides was suspended for 11 months with no monetary sanctions due to his financial situation."
