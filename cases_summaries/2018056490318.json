  "OverallSummary": "Between March 2016 and April 2022, George Apolonides (also known as George Apollo) engaged in excessive trading in four customer accounts, three of whom were seniors. Apolonides exercised de facto control over these accounts and recommended excessive transactions that resulted in high turnover rates (17 to 38) and cost-to-equity ratios (71% to 125%). These trading practices generated $618,911 in total trading costs (including $563,263 in commissions) while causing $735,376 in realized losses across the four accounts. Specific examples include a 69-year-old physician who suffered $326,684 in losses with a 114% cost-to-equity ratio and a 79-year-old semi-retired banker who lost $115,721 with a 76% cost-to-equity ratio. Apolonides's actions were found to be excessive, unsuitable, and not in the best interest of his customers, violating Regulation Best Interest and FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."
