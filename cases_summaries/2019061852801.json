  "OverallSummary": "From September 2014 through February 2023, Haywood Securities (USA) Inc. recommended 134 sales totaling almost $11 million of 53 different Canadian non-brokered private placements to U.S. customers without conducting reasonable due diligence. The firm generally did not conduct due diligence beyond a search and review of the issuer's recent public filings, relying mostly on the issuer with little to no independent verification. The firm failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with suitability requirements and later with Regulation Best Interest. The firm also failed to file offering documents with FINRA in connection with 236 Canadian private placement offerings."
