    "OverallSummary": "From May 2014 to December 2021, Robinhood converted market orders, stop orders, and trailing stop orders into limit orders, a practice known as 'collaring.' While intended to prevent executions at extreme prices, Robinhood's disclosures about this practice were inaccurate or incomplete. From August 2016 to June 2021, over 8.7 million collared orders did not execute and were canceled. Some customers re-entered their market orders and received less favorable executions than they would have initially, resulting in at least $3.75 million in collective losses. The firm failed to adequately disclose how collaring worked despite receiving thousands of customer inquiries about failed order executions."

    "OverallSummary": "From November 2018 through July 2022, Robinhood Securities improperly rejected approximately 116,000 customer requests to transfer their accounts to another brokerage firm through the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS). The firm rejected transfers for improper reasons including the presence of unsettled transactions, crypto asset holdings in a separate affiliated account, or options that would expire within five days, none of which are valid reasons to reject transfers under FINRA rules."
