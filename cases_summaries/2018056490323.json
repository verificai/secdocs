  "OverallSummary": "Between February 2020 and March 2022, Justin R. Deiter engaged in excessive trading in two retail customers' accounts, including one senior customer. For Customer A, a 49-year-old merchandiser described as a conservative investor, Deiter exercised de facto control over the account and recommended 32 transactions that resulted in an annualized turnover rate of 7 and a cost-to-equity ratio of 34%. This trading generated $19,792 in commissions while causing $25,291 in realized losses. For Customer B, an 89-year-old retiree with a speculation investment objective, Deiter recommended 28 transactions that resulted in an annualized turnover rate of 14 and a cost-to-equity ratio of 35%. This trading generated $28,264 in commissions while causing $33,363 in realized losses. Deiter's actions were found to be excessive and not in the best interest of his customers, willfully violating Regulation Best Interest and FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."
