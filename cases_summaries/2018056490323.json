  "Overall summary": "Justin R. Deiter excessively traded two retail customers' accounts between February 2020 and March 2022. For Customer A, a 49-year-old merchandiser described as a 'conservative investor,' Deiter recommended 32 transactions resulting in an annualized turnover rate of 7 and a cost-to-equity ratio of 34%, generating $19,792 in commissions while causing $25,291 in realized losses. Customer A relied on Deiter's advice and always followed his recommendations, giving him de facto control over the account. For Customer B, an 89-year-old retiree with a 'speculation' investment objective, Deiter recommended 28 transactions resulting in an annualized turnover rate of 14 and a cost-to-equity ratio of 35%, generating $28,264 in commissions while causing $33,363 in realized losses. The high cost-to-equity ratios (34% and 35%) indicate the customers' accounts would need to appreciate by those percentages annually just to break even. Deiter was suspended for six months with no monetary sanctions due to his financial situation."
