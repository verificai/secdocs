  "Overall summary": "Tory A. Duggins excessively traded the accounts of eight customers (including three seniors) from December 2016 through April 2022. His trading resulted in extremely high cost-to-equity ratios (ranging from 58% to 289%) and turnover rates (ranging from 14.36 to 63.24), generating $444,176 in total trading costs (including $343,416 in commissions) while causing $235,494 in realized losses. For example, he recommended 305 transactions in a 68-year-old retiree's IRA over three years, resulting in a 59% cost-to-equity ratio and causing $92,995 in realized losses. Duggins exercised de facto control over the accounts as customers relied on and routinely followed his recommendations. Additionally, Duggins willfully failed to disclose a customer complaint seeking $17,500 in compensatory damages on his Form U4. He was suspended for 18 months with no monetary sanctions due to his financial situation."
