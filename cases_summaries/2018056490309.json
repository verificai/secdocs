  "OverallSummary": "From December 2016 through April 2022, Tory A. Duggins engaged in excessive trading in eight customer accounts, three of whom were seniors. Duggins exercised de facto control over these accounts and recommended excessive transactions resulting in extremely high cost-to-equity ratios (58% to 289%) and turnover rates (14.36 to 63.24). This trading generated $444,176 in total trading costs (including $343,416 in commissions) while causing $235,494 in realized losses across the eight accounts. Specific examples include a 76-year-old retiree who suffered $19,575 in losses with a 93% cost-to-equity ratio, a 68-year-old retiree with an IRA who lost $92,995 with a 59% cost-to-equity ratio, and a 42-year-old self-employed individual who lost $17,829 with a 101% cost-to-equity ratio. Duggins also failed to disclose a customer complaint seeking $17,500 in compensatory damages. His actions violated Regulation Best Interest, FINRA Rule 2111, and FINRA Rule 2010."
