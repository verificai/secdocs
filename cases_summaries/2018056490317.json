  "OverallSummary": "Between February 2016 and April 2022, Kyle Infinite Manning engaged in excessive trading in three senior customers' accounts. Manning exercised de facto control over these accounts and recommended excessive transactions that resulted in extremely high turnover rates (22 to 40) and cost-to-equity ratios (81% to 101%). This trading generated $1,625,977 in total trading costs (including $1,477,893 in commissions) while causing $1,101,277 in realized losses across the three accounts. Specific examples include a 67-year-old semi-retired business owner who suffered $313,220 in losses with a 101% cost-to-equity ratio, a 62-year-old self-employed business owner who lost $597,759 with a 95% cost-to-equity ratio, and an 81-year-old semi-retired business owner who lost $190,298 with an 81% cost-to-equity ratio. Manning's actions were found to be excessive, unsuitable, and not in the best interest of his customers, violating Regulation Best Interest and FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."
