    "OverallSummary": "From June 2018 to February 2020, Cova Capital Partners recommended and sold private placement offerings from Issuer 1 to nine investors totaling over $2 million, without conducting proper due diligence. The firm failed to verify that Issuer 1 actually possessed the pre-IPO shares of Company A it was purporting to sell, and did not determine the markups being applied. The SEC later filed fraud charges against Issuer 1 for charging undisclosed, excessive markups and not having enough pre-IPO shares to satisfy investor sales."
