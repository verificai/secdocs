  "OverallSummary": "SpeedTrader (formerly Mint Global Markets) failed to comply with best execution obligations from 2017 to present by not conducting proper reviews of execution quality beyond price disimprovement. The firm routed customer orders totaling approximately 100 million shares annually to three broker-dealers engaged in net trading, interjecting third parties between the firm and the best market for securities. Additionally, SpeedTrader failed to establish an adequate anti-money laundering program from 2017 to 2022, not properly detecting and investigating suspicious trading patterns, particularly in low-priced securities. The firm also violated disclosure requirements by filing inaccurate Form CRS responses regarding its disciplinary history. The case primarily involves the firm's systemic failures in supervision and compliance rather than specific customer losses."
