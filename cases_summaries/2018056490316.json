  "OverallSummary": "Between February 2016 and April 2022, Kostas Tsamos (also known as Gus Tsamos) engaged in excessive trading in six customer accounts, four of whom were seniors. Tsamos exercised de facto control over these accounts and recommended excessive transactions that resulted in high turnover rates (10 to 21) and cost-to-equity ratios (38% to 82%). These trading practices generated $958,948 in total trading costs (including $849,576 in commissions) while causing over $1.03 million in realized losses across the six accounts. Specific examples include a 78-year-old retiree who suffered $123,622 in losses with a 52% cost-to-equity ratio, a 65-year-old real estate professional who lost $253,388 with a 38% cost-to-equity ratio, and a 58-year-old contractor who lost $343,960 with an 82% cost-to-equity ratio. Tsamos's actions were found to be excessive, unsuitable, and not in the best interest of his customers, violating Regulation Best Interest and FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."
