  "OverallSummary": "Between October 2019 and April 2022, Jesse D. Krapf engaged in excessive trading in a senior business owner's account. Krapf exercised de facto control over the account and recommended excessive in-and-out trading that resulted in an annualized turnover rate of 23 and an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 104%. This trading generated $96,496 in total trading costs (including $92,847 in commissions) while causing $41,017 in realized losses. Specific examples of excessive trading include recommending the purchase of $180,000 in biotechnology stock, then selling it two days later with $7,800 in commissions, followed by purchasing $82,000 in a semiconductor company and selling it the same day for a loss with $2,000 in commissions. Krapf's actions were found to be excessive, unsuitable, and not in the best interest of his customer, violating Regulation Best Interest and FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."
