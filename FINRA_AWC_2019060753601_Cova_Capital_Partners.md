# Analysis of FINRA AWC No. 2019060753601 - Cova Capital Partners LLC

## Violations of Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii) - The "Care Obligation"

This analysis examines the violations by Cova Capital Partners LLC related to the Care Obligation under Regulation Best Interest as detailed in FINRA's Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) No. 2019060753601.

### Care Obligation Requirements (As Defined in the Document):
- Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii) requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to "exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill" to understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with a recommendation
- The document notes that "reasonable diligence" depends on the complexity of and risks associated with the recommended security
- Broker-dealers must have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation could be in the best interest of at least some retail investors

### Specific Care Obligation Violations by Cova:

1. **Offering 1 (Pre-IPO Shares of Company A)**:
   - Failed to verify whether Issuer 1 actually possessed or had rights to the shares of Company A
   - Did not investigate the markups applied by Issuer 1 to the shares, despite knowing markups were being charged
   - These failures meant Cova had "no reasonable basis to believe that Issuer 1 had access to or possession of the pre-IPO shares identified in the offering documents, or that Issuer 1's markups were reasonable and properly disclosed"

2. **Offering 2**:
   - Failed to exercise reasonable diligence regarding Issuer 2's management
   - Did not identify that Issuer 2's Chief Executive Officer was previously subject to federal and state regulatory actions related to illegal robocalls targeting senior consumers
   - This background information would have been material to assessing the risks of the investment

3. **Offering 3 (Pre-IPO Shares of Company B)**:
   - Failed to verify Issuer 3's ownership of or rights to Company B shares
   - Ignored information concerning SEC charges filed against individuals associated with another fund from which Issuer 3 claimed to source Company B shares
   - The failure to investigate these red flags violated the reasonable diligence requirement

### The Document's Direct Statement on Care Obligation Violation:
The document specifically states that "By recommending to its customers three private offerings without conducting due diligence sufficient to form a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendations were suitable for and in the best interest of at least some investors, Cova willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) and violated FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."

While the AWC cites the overall Reg BI violation as 15l-1(a)(1), the substantive description of the violations specifically addresses failures under the Care Obligation [15l-1(a)(2)(ii)]. The failures to conduct adequate due diligence, investigate red flags, and understand the fundamental attributes of the investments all demonstrate that Cova did not exercise the "reasonable diligence, care, and skill" required by the Care Obligation.

### Consequences:
- $30,000 fine
- Censure
- Implementation of proper supervisory systems and procedures within 60 days
- Statutory disqualification from FINRA membership due to the willful violation

### Impact on Investors:
The case highlights how the firm's failures put retail investors at significant risk by:
1. Recommending private placements without confirming the issuers had legitimate access to the securities being sold
2. Not investigating the backgrounds of issuer management teams
3. Ignoring red flags that could have protected investors from potentially fraudulent offerings
4. Not determining if markups charged to investors were reasonable or properly disclosed

These violations occurred during a period when Regulation Best Interest had been implemented (after June 30, 2020), which requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail customers when making investment recommendations.
