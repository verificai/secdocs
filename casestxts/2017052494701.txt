RE:

LPL Financial LLC (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 6413

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent LPL Financial LLC submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
LPL became a FINRA member in 1973. The firm conducts a general securities business
and is headquartered in Fort Mill, South Carolina. LPL has over 27,000 registered
representatives operating out of over 18,000 branch offices. 1
OVERVIEW
From January 2012 to August 2019, LPL failed to reasonably supervise transactions that
the firm’s registered representatives placed directly with product sponsors on behalf of
firm customers (i.e., direct business transactions) in violation of NASD Rule 3010 and
FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. 2 LPL did not take steps reasonably designed to ensure that
its representatives reported such transactions on the trade blotter the firm used to identify
potential sales practice violations, resulting in approximately 830,000 such transactions
not appearing on the blotter. The firm did not supervise these transactions since it did not
generate exception reports from these transactions to identify potential sales practice
violations, including potentially unsuitable transactions. For approximately two million
additional direct business transactions, LPL also failed to ensure that it collected
information for customers’ investment profiles (e.g., customers’ ages, investment time

horizons, and liquidity needs) that was relevant for making certain suitability
determinations. By failing to collect required customer information, LPL failed to make
and preserve required books and records in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 17a-3, NASD Rule 3010, and FINRA Rules
3110, 4511 and 2010.
Additionally, from February 2016 through June 2020, LPL sent to customers
approximately 11,300 switch letters that contained inaccurate information about the
charges customers incurred by switching from one security to another in violation of
FINRA Rule 2010. LPL also violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010 by failing to
reasonably supervise the suitability of certain transactions because the firm’s supervisory
review tool contained incorrect information about the charges customers paid in
connection with certain switches.
Finally, from May 2017 to November 2022, LPL violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010
and Rule 15l-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to establish, maintain,
and enforce a supervisory system, including written procedures, reasonably designed to
ensure that recommendations of publicly traded securities of business development
companies (Listed BDCs) complied with FINRA Rule 2111 and Regulation Best
Interest’s Care Obligation.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from FINRA’s examination of LPL; certain self-disclosures made
to FINRA by LPL pursuant to FINRA Rule 4530; and a customer complaint.
1. LPL failed to reasonably supervise direct business transactions.
FINRA Rule 3110(a) and its predecessor, NASD Rule 3010(a), require each member firm
to establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of each associated person
that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and
regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. A violation of NASD Rule 3010 or
FINRA Rule 3110 is also a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires member firms
to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade
in the conduct of their business.
a. LPL did not reasonably supervise direct business transactions.
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 and its predecessor, NASD Rule 2310,
required member firms and their associated persons to have a reasonable basis to believe
that a recommended securities transaction or investment strategy is suitable for a
customer, based on information obtained through the reasonable diligence of the firm or
associated person to ascertain the customer’s investment profile. 3 A customer’s
investment profile includes, but is not limited to, the customer’s age, other investments,
3

financial situation and needs, investment objectives, investment experience, investment
time horizon, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance. FINRA Rule 2111 Supplementary
Material .04 stated that a member or associated person shall make a recommendation
“only if” the member or associated person had sufficient information about the customer
to have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation is suitable for that
customer, and that the customer profile information is generally relevant to make a
suitability determination.
LPL supervised direct business transactions, in part, by reviewing exception reports
relevant to identifying potential sales practice violations, including potentially unsuitable
transactions such as potential short-term trades of class A mutual fund shares; switches
between prospectus-based investment products (e.g., a mutual fund and a Unit Investment
Trust); and certain purchases of class B and C mutual fund shares. The firm used its daily
trade blotter to generate such exception reports.
From January 2012 to August 2019, LPL did not have a reasonable system to ensure that
direct business transactions appeared on the daily trade blotter in order for those
transactions to be ingested into the firm’s exception reports. Although LPL received from
product sponsors commission records for all direct business transactions, the firm did not
populate certain of those transactions onto the daily trade blotter until its registered
representatives manually reported them to the firm. LPL did not have a reasonable system
to ensure that registered representatives did so.
LPL was on notice that certain of its representatives were not reporting direct business
transactions when it received commission records from product sponsors. In such
circumstances, LPL alerted the representative to the unreported transaction, and if the
transaction remained unreported for more than 30 days, the firm fined the representative
$5 per transaction per month. During one six-month period in 2017, LPL identified more
than 1,300 representatives who had 10 or more unreported direct business transactions,
and the firm issued nearly 82,000 fines. Nonetheless, LPL did not take further action that
would have required representatives to report the transactions, and the firm continued to
collect fines for unreported transactions. As a result, from January 2012 to August 2019,
approximately 830,000 direct business transactions were not reported on the trade blotter
LPL used to identify potential sales practice violations. The firm therefore failed to
supervise these transactions since it did not generate exception reports from these
transactions to identify potentially unsuitable transactions.
LPL also failed to have a reasonable supervisory system to ensure the collection of
information for its direct business customers’ investment profiles—such as the
customers’ ages, investment time horizons, and liquidity needs—that was relevant for
making suitability determinations. LPL relied on its representatives to collect such
information by completing new account forms for direct business transactions. However,
the firm did not take steps to ensure that representatives completed the new account
forms. As a result, LPL failed to ensure that it collected essential information about
certain direct business customers that was relevant to assessing whether their direct
business transactions were suitable.

Starting in 2020, LPL began a retrospective review of its direct business transactions
during the relevant period. That review identified 98 purchases of class C mutual fund
shares that were potentially unsuitable and inconsistent with LPL’s written supervisory
procedures, which prohibited certain customers with long investment horizons from
holding large class C share balances. LPL’s review also identified 74 purchases of class
B mutual fund shares that were potentially inconsistent with customers’ investment
horizons and liquidity needs. Collectively, those transactions caused customers to pay
approximately $546,000 in potentially excessive sales charges (as set forth in Attachment
A). Additionally, LPL’s review was unable to determine the suitability of approximately
13,000 transactions because the firm was unable, at the time of the retrospective review,
to collect complete information about those customers’ investment profiles, including
their investment time horizons or liquidity needs.
Therefore, LPL violated NASD Rule 3010(a) and FINRA Rules 3110(a) and 2010.
b. LPL’s failure to reasonably supervise direct business transactions caused
the firm to maintain inaccurate books and records.
FINRA Rule 4511 requires member firms and associated persons to make and preserve
books and records as required by FINRA rules, the Exchange Act, and applicable
Exchange Act rules. Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires firms to “make and
keep . . . such records . . . as the [SEC], by rule, prescribes.” Exchange Act Rule 17a3(a)(17)(i)(A), in turn, requires firms to maintain, for each customer who is a natural
person—and for whom the firm is required to make a suitability determination—an
account record containing the customer’s name, tax identification number, address,
telephone number, date of birth, employment status, occupation, annual income, net
worth, and investment objectives. Implicit in the requirement to make and preserve books
and records is the requirement that information in those books and records be accurate
and complete. A violation of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 or FINRA Rule 4511 also
constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
LPL failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to comply
with recordkeeping requirements for direct business transactions. In particular, the firm
did not have a reasonably designed system to verify whether it had collected and
maintained customer account information required by Exchange Act Rule 17a3(a)(17)(i)(A), including customers’ ages and investment objectives.
Therefore, LPL violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rule 17a-3,
NASD Rule 3010(a), and FINRA Rules 3110(a), 4511 and 2010.

2. LPL provided inaccurate information to customers about switch transactions
and failed to reasonably supervise these transactions.
a. LPL sent customers approximately 11,300 letters that materially misstated
the fees customers incurred in connection with product switches.
A negligent misstatement of material fact to a customer violates FINRA Rule 2010.
From February 2016 through June 2020, LPL sent to customers approximately 11,300
letters that misstated the sales charges associated with switching from one security to
another (“switch letters”). LPL sent switch letters to its customers when they purchased a
prospectus-based product (such as a mutual fund or Unit Investment Trust, both of which
charged customers upfront sales charges) within 45 days of selling such a product. Such
letters provided the customer with important information about the transaction, including
any sales charges the customer paid in connection with the switch.
First, LPL sent approximately 9,800 switch letters that erroneously stated that switches
involving UITs and direct business mutual funds had zero sales charges. 4 This was
because the firm databases that LPL used to generate the switch letters did not include
sales charges for transactions involving these products. Second, for approximately 1,500
switch letters, LPL populated the letters with sales charge data concerning the customers’
most recent transactions in the relevant securities rather than the specific purchases
associated with the switch. For example, LPL sent one customer a switch letter reflecting
a sales charge of 1% in connection with a switch transaction for which the customer was
actually charged more than 2%. Although the trade confirmations associated with this
transaction were correct, the switch letter understated the total fees charged to the
customer by approximately $4,000.
Therefore, LPL violated FINRA Rule 2010.
b. LPL failed to reasonably supervise the suitability of switch transactions.
To review the suitability of switch transactions during the relevant period, LPL relied, in
part, on an automated alert that flagged certain switch transactions in the firm’s
supervisory review tool. The tool provided the firm’s principals with information about
flagged transactions, including sales charge data. However, the tool extracted sales
charge data from the same databases described above, which did not include information
regarding sales charges for transactions in certain products. Therefore, the tool did not
present the supervisors with accurate information about the costs customers incurred. As
a result, LPL failed to detect that certain UIT and mutual fund switch transactions may
have been unsuitable.
For example, LPL did not identify certain potentially unsuitable transactions involving
UITs, which the firm’s written supervisory procedures recognized are a “buy and hold”
Although customers and supervisors had access to accurate fee information through a number of other sources
(e.g., confirms, prospectuses, etc.), the switch letters at issue misstated the fees at issue.

4

product and “are not intended for short term trading.” Without the correct sales charge
information, LPL failed to detect that certain representatives recommended that
customers sell UITs substantially in advance of their maturity dates and use the sale
proceeds to purchase a new UIT. Sometimes the representatives recommended successive
purchases of UITs with the same or substantially similar investment objectives to the UIT
that had been sold. Based on inaccurate sales charges, LPL also did not identify that
certain representatives recommended that customers sell one class A mutual fund (which,
because they imposed significant upfront sales charges, are generally appropriate for
customers with long-term investment horizons) only to buy another class A mutual fund
with a similar investment objective.
In total, LPL failed to reasonably identify approximately 50 potentially unsuitable
switches involving UITs and mutual funds. Collectively, such transactions caused
customers to pay approximately $31,000 in sales charges (as set forth in Attachment B).
Therefore, LPL violated FINRA Rules 3110(a) and 2010.
3. LPL failed to reasonably supervise Listed BDC transactions.
FINRA Rule 3110 requires member firms to maintain supervisory systems that are
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws, regulations,
and FINRA rules. A recommendation may be unsuitable if it results in a concentration in
a particular security or category of securities that creates a risk of loss inconsistent with
the customer’s investment profile. FINRA Rule 2111 defines a “customer’s investment
profile” to include, but not be limited to, the customer’s age, other investments, financial
situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment
time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information the customer may
disclose to the member or associated person in connection with such recommendation.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation Best Interest under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Reg BI’s
Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(iv), requires a brokerdealer to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI, including Reg BI’s Care Obligation. The
Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers should consider the nature of that firm’s
operations and how to design such policies and procedures to prevent violations from
occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and to correct promptly any violations
that have occurred. 5 A violation of Reg BI also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule
2010.
Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires brokerdealers and their associated persons to have a reasonable basis to believe that a
recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities
(including account recommendations) to a retail customer is in the best interest of a
5

Adopting Release at 33397.

particular retail customer based on that retail customer’s investment profile and the
potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with the recommendation. Reg BI defines a
“retail customer investment profile” to include the same information as FINRA Rule
2111.
In Regulatory Notice 22-08, FINRA reminded firms to apply heightened supervision to
recommendations of products with features that may make it difficult for a retail investor
to understand the essential characteristics of the product and its risks.
Certain business development companies invest in debt and equity of small and mediumsized companies that do not have ready access to public capital markets or other forms of
conventional financing. Business development companies may be in their early stages of
development and may not be able to obtain bank loans or raise money from other
investors. BDCs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable ordinary income as
dividends to shareholders in return for favorable tax treatment.
Listed BDCs have certain risks, including: (a) exposure to investments rated below
investment grade; (b) portfolios that are difficult to value given the underlying
companies’ lack of operating history and public disclosures; (c) illiquid underlying
investments; (d) use of leverage in excess of that available to registered investment
companies; and (e) fee structures that result in high operating fees and expenses.
However, from May 2017 to November 2022, LPL’s supervisory system, including
written procedures, was not reasonably designed to ensure that recommendations of
Listed BDCs complied with FINRA Rule 2111 and Reg BI’s Care Obligation.
Specifically, LPL relied on an electronic tool, which generated alerts to supervisors, to
identify recommendations involving high concentration levels that were potentially
unsuitable or not in the best interest of a particular retail customer. However, this tool did
not reasonably alert supervisors when LPL registered representatives made
recommendations of potentially overconcentrated investments in Listed BDCs to
customers with low and moderate risk tolerance. 6
As a result, LPL supervisors were not alerted when recommendations resulted in 16
customers with low and moderate risk tolerance becoming overconcentrated in Listed
BDC investments between May 2017 and November 2022. These customers incurred
$73,930 in realized losses (as set forth in Attachment C). In certain of these instances, the
customers’ investments in Listed BDCs exceeded half of their household assets.
Through this conduct, LPL violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1, FINRA Rule 3110 and
FINRA Rule 2010.

In June 2021, a registered representative from the firm consented to an AWC with FINRA that included findings,
among others, that the representative made unsuitable recommendations to customers, resulting in their
overconcentration in Listed BDCs.

B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:


a censure;



a $5.5 million fine;



restitution of $651,374.51 plus interest as described below; and



an undertaking that, within 90 days of the date of the notice of acceptance of this
AWC, a member of LPL’s senior management who is a registered principal of the
firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification, the firm has
remediated the Listed BDC issues identified in this AWC and implemented a
supervisory system, including written procedures, reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with Reg BI regarding the Listed BDC issues identified in this AWC.
The certification shall include a narrative description and supporting exhibits
sufficient to demonstrate the firm’s remediation and implementation. FINRA staff
may request further evidence of LPL’s remediation and implementation, and the
firm agrees to provide such evidence. LPL shall submit the certification to
Meghan A. Ferguson, FINRA Enforcement Director, at
meghan.ferguson@finra.org, with copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. Upon
written request showing good cause, FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachments A, B and C to
this AWC (Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $651,374.51, plus interest at the
rate set forth in Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2),
from November 30, 2022 until the date this AWC is accepted by the National
Adjudicatory Council (NAC).
A registered principal on behalf of Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment
of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each
Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect
restitution. Such proof shall be submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org
from a work-related account of the registered principal of Respondent. The email must
identify Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order,
or other method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.
The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all

Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
AWC, Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not unacceptable to
FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanctions in this AWC, and
the timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their
own actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:
A.

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B.

To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.
Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions

regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.
