RE:

Kostas Tsamos also known as Gus Tsamos (Respondent)
Former General Securities Representative
CRD No. 2782014

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Kostas Tsamos submits this Letter of Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule
violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if accepted, FINRA
will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based on the same
factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Tsamos first registered with FINRA in October 1996. From January 2016 through
December 22, 2022, Tsamos was registered with FINRA as a General Securities
Representative and a General Securities Principal through an association with Spartan
Capital Securities, LLC (CRD No. 146251).
On June 6, 2024, FINRA suspended Tsamos indefinitely for failing to comply with an
arbitration settlement agreement, pursuant to Article VI, Section 3 of FINRA’s By-Laws
and FINRA Rule 9554. Although Tsamos is no longer registered or associated with a
FINRA member firm, he remains subject to FINRA’s jurisdiction pursuant to Article V,
Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws. 1
OVERVIEW
Between February 2016 and April 2022, Tsamos recommended a series of trades in six
customers’ accounts, four of whom were senior customers, that was excessive,
unsuitable, and not in the customers’ best interests. As a result, Tsamos willfully violated

the Best Interest Obligation under Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Regulation BI) and violated FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from a FINRA cycle examination of Spartan.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation BI under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of Reg
BI requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
securities (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best
interest of that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing
the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the
interest of the retail customer. Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule
15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable
diligence, care, and skill to, among other things, have a reasonable basis to believe that a
series of recommended transactions, even if in the retail customer’s best interest when
viewed in isolation, is not excessive and is in the retail customer’s best interest in light of
the retail customer’s investment profile.
No single test defines when trading is excessive, but factors such as the turnover rate, the
cost-to-equity ratio, and the use of in-and-out trading in a customer’s account are relevant
to determining whether a member firm or associated person has excessively traded a
customer’s account in violation of Reg BI. The turnover rate represents the number of
times that a portfolio of securities is exchanged for another portfolio of securities. The
cost-to-equity ratio measures the amount an account must appreciate just to cover
commissions and other expenses. In other words, it is the break-even point where a
customer may begin to see a return. A turnover rate of six or more, or a cost-to-equity
ratio above 20 percent, generally indicates that a series of recommended transactions was
excessive.
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 required members and associated persons to
have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation of a transaction or investment
strategy involving a security or securities to any customer is suitable for the customer.
Under Rule 2111.05(c), members and associated persons with actual or de facto control
over an account were required to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of
recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, is not excessive
and unsuitable for the customer in light of the customer's investment profile. FINRA Rule
2111 is still in effect, but as of June 30, 2020, it no longer applies to recommendations
that are subject to Reg BI, and the element of control was removed from the quantitative
suitability component.
A violation of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 2111 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires associated persons to “observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade” in the conduct of their business.

Between February 2016 and April 2022, Tsamos excessively traded six customers’
accounts. His customers relied on his advice and routinely followed his recommendations
and, as a result, Tsamos exercised de facto control over the customers’ accounts.
Tsamos’s trading resulted in high turnover rates and cost-to-equity ratios that were well
above the traditional guideposts of six and 20 percent, respectively, as well as significant
losses, as set forth below. Specifically, Tsamos’s trading in the six customer accounts
resulted in annualized turnover rates of 10 to 21 and annualized cost-to-equity ratios of
38% to 82% while generating total trading costs of $958,948, including $849,576 in
commissions, and causing over $1.03 million in total realized losses. For example:


In February 2016, Customer A opened an account at Spartan with Tsamos. At the
time, Customer A was a 78-year-old retiree. Customer A’s investment objective
was aggressive growth/aggressive income. Between )HEUXDU\ 2016 and January
2022,Tsamos recommended 439 transactions in Customer A’s account resulting
in anannualized turnover rate of 18 and an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 52%.
Tsamos’s trading in Customer A’s account generated total trading costs of
$182,860, including $150,221 in commissions, and caused $123,622 in realized
losses.



In March 2016, Customer B opened an account at Spartan with Tsamos. At the
time, Customer B was a 65-year-old real estate professional. Customer B’s
investment objective was aggressive growth/aggressive income. Between March
2016 and March 2020, Tsamos recommended 255 transactions in Customer B’s
account resulting in an annualized turnover rate of 11 and an annualized cost-toequity ratio of 38%. Tsamos’s trading in Customer B’s account generated total
trading costs of $214,311, including $195,655 in commissions, and caused
$253,388 in realized losses.



In July 2017, Customer C opened an account at Spartan with Tsamos. At the time,
Customer C was a 58-year-old contractor. Customer C’s investment objective was
speculation. Between July 2017 and April 2022, Tsamos recommended 276
transactions in Customer C’s account resulting in an annualized turnover rate of
21 and an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 82%. Tsamos’s trading in Customer
C’s account generated total trading costs of $257,610, including $237,070 in
commissions, and caused $343,960 in realized losses.

The level of trading that Tsamos recommended in the six customers’ accounts was
excessive, unsuitable, and not in the best interest of the customers.
Therefore, Tsamos willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) and violated FINRA
Rules 2111 and 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanction:


a 17-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all
capacities.

Respondent has submitted a statement of financial condition and demonstrated an
inability to pay. In light of Respondent’s financial status, no monetary sanctions have
been imposed.
Respondent understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member, he becomes subject to a statutory disqualification as that term is defined
in Article III, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, incorporating Section 3(a)(39) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, he may not be associated with any
FINRA member in any capacity, including clerical or ministerial functions, during the
period of the bar or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that he willfully violated
Rule 15l-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that under Article III, Section 4 of
FINRA’s By-Laws, this makes him subject to a statutory disqualification with respect to
association with a member.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
