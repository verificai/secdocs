RE:

Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 13577
Michael Molinaro (Respondent)
General Securities Principal
CRD No. 2358346

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondents Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. and Michael
Molinaro submit this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of
proposing a settlement of the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on
the condition that, if accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondents
alleging violations based on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondents accept and consent to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Network 1 has been a FINRA member firm since 1983. The firm, which is headquartered
in Red Bank, New Jersey, has 14 branch offices and approximately 100 registered
representatives.
Molinaro first registered with FINRA in 1993. In February 2014, Molinaro registered as a
General Securities Representative and General Securities Principal, among other
registrations, through an association with Network 1. Beginning in July 2017, Molinaro
was Network 1’s chief compliance officer.
In 2015, Molinaro entered into an AWC in which he consented to findings, including that
he failed to enforce a reasonably designed supervisory system with respect to private
placements while associated with another broker-dealer. The AWC suspended Molinaro
from association with any FINRA member firm in any principal capacity for 45 days.
In 2009, the State of Idaho entered an Order and Agreement finding that Molinaro, while
associated with another broker-dealer, had failed to disclose on a Uniform Application

for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U4) registering another employee
in Idaho, an Iowa order establishing heightened supervision for that employee. The Order
and Agreement cautioned Molinaro to refrain from violating the Idaho Uniform
Securities Act of 2004 and also mandated that in the future he comply with the provisions
of the Act. 1
OVERVIEW
From January 2016 through March 2022, Network 1 did not establish, maintain, and
enforce a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures (WSPs),
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the suitability requirements of FINRA
Rule 2111 and the Care Obligation of Rule 15l-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Regulation BI or Reg BI) 2 as they pertain to excessive trading in violation of FINRA
Rules 3110 and 2010. As of June 30, 2020, Network 1 also violated Reg BI’s Compliance
Obligation by not establishing, maintaining, and enforcing WSPs reasonably designed to
achieve compliance with Reg BI.
Additionally, from July 2017 through March 2022, Molinaro violated FINRA Rules 3110
and 2010 by not establishing, maintaining, and enforcing a supervisory system, including
WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 2111 and, as of
June 30, 2020, Reg BI, as they pertain to excessive trading.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
A. The Applicable Rules.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Reg BI. Reg BI requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a
broker or dealer, when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or
investment strategy involving securities (including account recommendations) to a retail
customer, to act in the best interest of that retail customer at the time the recommendation
is made, without placing the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated
person ahead of the interest of the retail customer. Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at
Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to
exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to, among other things, have a reasonable
basis to believe that a series of recommended transactions, even if in the retail customer’s
best interest when viewed in isolation, is not excessive and is in the retail customer’s best
interest in light of the retail customer’s investment profile.
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 required members and associated persons to
have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy

The compliance date for Reg BI was June 30, 2020. Also, effective June 30, 2020, FINRA amended Rule 2111 to
state that Rule 2111 will not apply to recommendations subject to Reg BI.

involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer. Under Rule 2111
Supplementary Material .05(c), members and associated persons with actual or de facto
control over an account were required to have a reasonable basis for believing that a
series of recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, are not
excessive and unsuitable for the customer in light of the customer’s investment profile.
No single test defines when trading is excessive, but factors such as the turnover rate, the
cost-to-equity ratio, and the use of in-and-out trading in a customer’s account are relevant
to determining whether a member firm or associated person has excessively traded a
customer’s account in violation of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 2111. The turnover rate
represents the number of times that a portfolio of securities is exchanged for another
portfolio of securities. The cost-to-equity ratio measures the amount an account must
appreciate just to cover commissions and other expenses. In other words, it is the breakeven point where a customer may begin to see a return. A turnover rate of six or a costto-equity ratio above 20 percent generally indicates that a series of recommended
transactions was excessive and not in the retail customer’s best interest.
Additionally, Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l1(a)(2)(iv), requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI, including the
Care Obligation. Reg BI’s Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers should consider
the nature of that firm’s operations and how to design such policies and procedures to
prevent violations from occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and to correct
promptly any violations that have occurred. 3
FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA Rules. The
duty to supervise under Rule 3110 also includes the responsibility for firms and their
designated supervisors to reasonably investigate red flags of potential misconduct and to
act upon the results of their investigation.
A violation of Exchange Act Rule 15l-1 and FINRA Rule 3110 also constitutes a
violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires that member firms and associated persons
“observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade”
in the conduct of their business.

B. Network 1 and Molinaro did not establish, maintain, and enforce WSPs
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 2111 and the Care
Obligation of Reg BI as they pertain to excessive trading.
From January 2016 through March 2022, Network 1’s WSPs were not reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 2111 and the Care Obligation of Reg
BI as they pertain to trading. Beginning in July 2017, the firm’s WSPs designated
Molinaro as the principal responsible for developing supervisory procedures for Network
1 with respect to all “products, services, or line functions that need to be the subject of
written compliance policies and written supervisory procedures.”
Prior to June 30, 2020, the firm’s WSPs were not reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with the suitability requirements of FINRA Rule 2111 with respect to
excessive trading. First, the WSPs did not set forth how the firm’s supervisors should
apply certain listed factors to identify potentially excessively traded accounts.
Significantly, the WSPs did not identify what cost-to-equity ratio or turnover rate was
suggestive of excessive trading. Moreover, the WSPs did not provide supervisors with
reasonable guidance about what steps they should take after identifying an excessively
traded account. For example, the WSPs did not specify when, or in what circumstances,
the supervisor should contact customers with actively traded accounts. The WSPs also
did not specify whether, or in what circumstances, supervisors should consider restricting
the commissions that could be charged in a customer’s account.
Network 1’s WSPs also were not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg
BI. Beginning in 2019, prior to Reg BI’s effective date of June 30, 2020, Network 1
developed revised procedures and issued written guidance to the firm’s representatives
about complying with Reg BI as it was expected to relate to excessive trading. In
particular, the firm issued guidance about the level of commissions that could be charged
in customers’ accounts, and the firm began to restrict the commissions that could be
charged in certain accounts. Network 1 and Molinaro also provided trainings in 2019 and
2020 about Reg BI’s requirement that registered representatives not place their own
interest ahead of those of their customers. But Network 1 and Molinaro did not revise the
firm’s WSPs to reference Reg BI until March 1, 2021, eight months after Reg BI’s
effective date. Moreover, even after Molinaro revised the firm’s WSPs in March 2021,
Network 1’s WSPs continued to provide only general background information about Reg
BI’s component obligations. The revised WSPs provided no guidance about what steps
the firm’s principals or representatives should take to prevent, detect, or promptly correct
violations of Reg BI or to otherwise achieve compliance with Reg BI.
As a result, from January 2016 through March 2022, Network 1 violated FINRA Rules
3110(b) and 2010, and from June 30, 2020 through March 2022, the firm also violated
Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation. Additionally, from July 2017 through March 2022,
Molinaro violated FINRA Rules 3110(b) and 2010.

C. Network 1 and Molinaro did not establish and maintain a reasonably designed
supervisory system and did not identify and respond to red flags of excessive
trading.
Network 1’s system for identifying excessively traded accounts was not reasonably
designed. Network 1 received exception reports from its clearing firm that were relevant
to identifying excessive trading—including a monthly report that flagged accounts with
high cost-to-equity ratios. However, from January 2016 through June 2018, the firm did
not review those reports. Instead, the firm limited its reviews to an internal report
identifying the 100 accounts with the largest year-to-date aggregate commissions. That
report, however, excluded smaller accounts that, even if they were not among the 100
accounts with the largest aggregate commissions, had high commission amounts relative
to their equity value. For example:
•

Network 1 received an active account report dated July 31, 2016, that showed
Customer A had been charged more than $18,000 in commissions in the prior 12
months, resulting in a cost-to-equity ratio of more than 45 percent. Because the
firm did not review that report, it did not identify excessive trading in Customer
A’s account and took no steps to address it. Customer A was charged more than
$20,000 in additional commissions between August 2016 and March 2018, by
which time the recommended trades in Customer A’s account resulted in an
annualized cost-to-equity ratio of more than 52 percent.

Moreover, even when Network 1 identified an excessively traded account, the firm did
not take steps to further investigate the excessive trading and to act upon the results of the
investigation. Molinaro, who beginning in July 2017 was the designated principal
responsible for determining what actions the firm took upon identifying red flags of
excessive trading, did not require Network 1 to take any steps, such as restricting the
commissions that representatives could charge in accounts, until April 2019. As a result,
in some instances, representatives continued charging high commissions even after the
firm was on notice that the account was being excessively traded. Moreover, even after
Network 1 began restricting the commissions that representatives could charge on
individual trades in certain accounts, the restrictions the firm imposed often were not
effective because they did not limit the number or frequency of trades or aggregate costs
and commissions that could be charged to the affected accounts. As a result, after a
restriction was in effect limiting the commissions that could be charged for each
individual trade, representatives were not prevented from placing frequent trades in a
customer’s account, thus earning commissions on a higher number of trades. For
example:
•

Network 1 received an active account report on February 28, 2021, showing that
Customer B had been charged more than $26,000 in commissions over the prior
month, resulting in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 20 percent. In response,
the firm restricted the commissions that could be charged on individual trades in
that account, lifted the commission restriction after only two months, then
reimposed it one month later. By November 30, 2021, Customer B had been
5

charged an additional $116,865 in commissions, despite the commission
restrictions, resulting in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 26 percent.
•

Network 1 received an active account report on October 31, 2020, showing that
Customer C had been charged $16,805 in commissions over the prior 12 months,
resulting in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of more than 27 percent and an
annualized turnover rate of 10. The following month, on November 30, 2021,
Network 1 received another active account report showing an additional $9,485 in
commissions charged to Customer C, resulting in an increased annualized cost-toequity ratio of 34 percent and an annualized turnover rate of 11. Network 1 twice
restricted the commissions that could be charged on individual trades in Customer
C’s account—first limiting individual trade commissions to one and a half
percent, then limiting them further to one percent. Nevertheless, over the next 12
months, Customer C was charged more than $125,000 in commissions. The active
account report Network 1 received on November 31, 2021, showed that the
annualized cost-to-equity ratio in Customer C’s account remained at an excessive
rate of 23 percent, and the annualized turnover rate increased to 12.

•

Network 1 received an active account report on July 31, 2021, showing that
Customer D had been charged $20,750 in commissions since opening his account
on February 11, 2021, resulting in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of more than
21 percent and an annualized turnover rate of 6. Network 1 restricted the
individual trade commissions charged in Customer D’s account to one and a half
percent but, over the next three months, Customer D was charged an additional
$8,400 in commissions. Notwithstanding the commission restrictions imposed,
the account’s annualized cost-to-equity ratio increased over that same time to 23
percent and the annualized turnover rate increased to 9.

As a result of these supervisory failures, Network 1 did not identify or address red flags
of excessive trading in eight customer accounts. In each account, Network 1’s
representatives recommended that the customers place frequent trades, and the customers
routinely relied on those recommendations. The level of trading in each account, which
resulted in a cost-to-equity ratio in excess of 20 percent, and in some cases cost-to-equity
ratios in excess of 50 percent, was inconsistent with the customers’ investment profiles
and was not in the customers’ best interest. Collectively, the recommended trading
caused these eight customers to pay more than $533,500 in commissions and trading
costs.
Therefore, from January 2016 through March 2022, Network 1 violated FINRA Rules
3110(a) and 2010. In addition, from July 2017 through March 2022, Molinaro violated
FINRA Rules 3110(a) and 2010.
B.

Respondents also consent to the imposition of the following sanctions:
For Network 1:


a censure;
6



a $200,000 fine;

FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

For Molinaro:


a three-month suspension from association with any FINRA member in all
principal capacities; and



a $5,000 fine.

Respondents agree to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Each Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it or he proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this AWC
(Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $533,587, plus interest at the rate set forth in
Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), from March
31, 2022, until the date this AWC is accepted by the National Adjudicatory Council
(NAC).
A registered principal on behalf of Network 1 shall submit satisfactory proof of payment
of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each
Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect
restitution. Such proof shall be submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org

identify Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order,
or other method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.

7

The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by Network 1 as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Network 1 is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
AWC, Network 1 shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Network 1’s plan, not unacceptable to
FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.
Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanctions in this AWC, and
the timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their
own actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

Corrective Action Statement

This Corrective Action Statement is submitted by Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc., the
Respondent in this AWC. This Corrective Action Statement does not constitute factual or legal
findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of FINRA, or its staff:
Corrective Action Taken by Network 1:
In the firm’s efforts to align its policies and procedures for trading in accounts that it deems to
be “actively traded” with SEC Regulation Best Interest (pp. 297-302), Network 1 amends
Section 9 of its Written Supervisory Procedures (WSPs), which Section deals with SEC
Regulation Best Interest, incorporating procedures that were developed by the firm in 2019
governing actively traded accounts, which procedures include additional heightened review of
those accounts.
