Please do the following:
- Create a local folder named with today’s date. 
- find ML-oriented papers from the last week in ArXiv with significant chatter about them on hacker news

- For each paper:
  - Create a subfolder in the date folder above
  - Create a summary of it called summary.txt
  - Summarize sentiment about it on hacker news with hackernews.txt
  - Put the link to the paper in paper.pdf.txt

- Create a pull request to git repo github.com:/fettermania/learning-papers which: 
    - adds the local folder to the GitHub repo.
    - updated INDEX.md to summarize and link to this folder in the style it’s using

The pull request https://github.com/fettermania/learning-papers/pull/1 is a great example you wrote.
