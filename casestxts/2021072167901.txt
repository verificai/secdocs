v.
Stewart Ginn
CRD No. 4503197,
Respondent.

COMPLAINT
The Department of Enforcement alleges:
SUMMARY
1.

Respondent Stewart Ginn, while registered through Independent Financial Group,

LLC (“IFG”), churned and excessively traded five customers’ accounts between July 2020 and
December 2022 (the “relevant period”).
2.

None of the five customers was an aggressive investor. Moreover, three of the

customers were retired seniors. During the relevant period in which Ginn was churning and
excessively trading their accounts, one of the customers was in her late 80s and suffering from
Alzheimer’s disease; a second retired customer was in her late 70s; and a third retired customer
was between 69 and 71 years old.
3.

Ginn engaged in frequent in-and-out trades in the five customers’ accounts, while

charging high commissions on both buys and sells. Ginn’s trading caused the five customers to
incur realized losses of more than $2.22 million, while generating more than $2.24 million in
commissions for Ginn and IFG.

4.

Ginn routinely recommended that the customers buy large equities positions,

which he often quickly sold, even when the price of the stocks had changed only minimally.
Because of the high commissions Ginn charged—generally three percent on buy transactions and
two percent on sell transactions—the customers routinely incurred losses on such trades.
5.

Further, in at least four of the customers’ accounts, Ginn improperly traded on

discretion and, in addition, frequently engaged in buying and selling securities without obtaining
customer authorization for each transaction.
6.

Disregarding the cumulative impact of his excessive, high-cost trading, Ginn

persisted in placing frequent trades in each of the customers’ accounts throughout the relevant
period, even as each account incurred substantial realized losses.
7.

Ginn’s trading resulted in annualized cost-to-equity ratios (or break-even points)

of between 14 percent to 27 percent in the customers’ accounts, making it unlikely they would
realize a profit.
8.

Acting with scienter and with de facto control over the five customers’ accounts,

Ginn churned these accounts in willful violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and in violation of FINRA Rules 2020
and 2010.
9.

By excessively trading the accounts owned by four retail customers, Ginn

willfully violated the Best Interest Obligation under Rule 15l-1(a) of the Exchange Act
(“Regulation BI”) and violated FINRA Rule 2010.
10.

By excessively and unsuitably trading the accounts of the fifth customer, a profit

sharing plan for a small dental practice, Ginn violated FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010.

2

11.

By exercising discretion without written authorization in four of the five

customers’ accounts, Ginn violated FINRA Rules 3260 and 2010.
RESPONDENT AND JURISDICTION
12.

Ginn entered the securities industry in 2002.

13.

Since 2015, Ginn has been registered as a General Securities Representative

through an association with IFG.
14.

Because Ginn is currently registered with FINRA, he is subject to FINRA’s

jurisdiction.
FACTS
15.

In 2019, Ginn bought the book of business of a former IFG registered

representative (Representative A) after Representative A’s sudden death in December 2018.
Thereafter, Ginn became the registered representative for Representative A’s former customer
accounts, including the five customers that are the subject of this Complaint.
16.

Customers 1 through 4 are individual investors who are retail customers.

17.

Customer 5, the profit sharing plan for a dental practice, is not a retail customer.

18.

None of the five customers had experience with short-term stock trading or its

costs, and none had an aggressive investment objective.
19.

On the contrary, each of the five customers pursued a long-term buy-and-hold

investment strategy in their accounts at IFG when Representative A was their registered
representative.
20.

Each of the four individual customers had a moderate risk tolerance, as reflected

in their account documents at IFG. The fifth customer, the profit sharing plan, had a moderate

3

risk tolerance for its first account at IFG and, after that account was closed in mid-2022, had a
risk tolerance of “moderately high” for its second account at IFG.
21.

During the relevant period, Ginn dramatically increased the frequency of trades in

the customers’ accounts, including placing frequent in-and-out trades in each account.
22.

Ginn exercised de facto control over each customer’s account.

23.

Ginn solicited all or nearly all of the transactions in each customer’s account.

24.

Each customer relied on Ginn to direct the trading in their accounts and

consistently followed Ginn’s recommendations. On those occasions when Ginn in fact obtained
authorization from the customers to buy or sell securities prior to Ginn executing these trades,
the customers routinely accepted Ginn’s recommendations as to what securities to buy or sell,
when to buy or sell, how frequently to buy and sell securities, and the quantity to buy or sell.
25.

In numerous other instances, Ginn exercised discretion and bought and sold

securities in the accounts of Customers 1 through 4 without first obtaining the customer’s
authorization for the trade.
26.

IFG’s written supervisory procedures (“WSPs”) did not permit Ginn to exercise

discretion to trade in any customer’s account.
27.

Ginn did not have written authorization from Customers 1 through 4 to exercise

discretion in their accounts.
28.

Prior to executing each trade in the customers’ accounts, Ginn determined and

manually entered the commission amount that he charged to the customer on each trade.
29.

From July 2020 through December 2022, Ginn generally charged the customers a

three percent commission on each purchase and a two percent commission on each sale.

4

30.

Ginn did not explain to the five customers the total commission amounts that he

would be charging for any trade, nor did he ever discuss the cumulative commissions he had
charged or how trading costs had impacted the five customers’ account values.
31.

When making recommendations (or when exercising discretion) regarding what

securities to buy and sell, how frequently to buy and sell securities, and what commissions to
charge in each of the five customer’s accounts, Ginn disregarded trading costs, the effects of the
cumulative trading costs resulting from his commissions, and how commissions were affecting
the value of customers’ accounts.
32.

Ginn’s trading in these accounts between July 2020 and December 2022 caused

the customers to suffer realized losses of more than $2.22 million. During that same period,
Ginn’s trading caused the customers to pay commissions of more than $2.24 million.
33.

Ginn received 93% of the commissions charged in these five accounts.

A. Ginn Churned and Excessively Traded Customer 1’s Account.
34.

Customer 1 is a 79-year-old retiree.

35.

Customer 1 first opened an IRA account with IFG in 2015 for which

Representative A was the registered representative.
36.

Between January 2017 and his death in December 2018, Representative A

recommended and executed fewer than three trades per month in Customer 1’s account.
37.

In July 2019, Ginn became the registered representative for Customer 1’s IRA

account at IFG.
38.

In October 2019, Customer 1 completed an IFG account update form for her

account, indicating her investment objective of “capital preservation” and “moderate” risk
tolerance.

5

39.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn recommended and effected 259

trades in Customer 1’s account, which resulted in approximately $556,000 in realized losses.
40.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn’s trading activity in Customer 1’s

account resulted in Customer 1 paying trading costs exceeding $494,000, including commissions
of nearly $494,000.
41.

The cost-to-equity ratio measures the amount an account has to appreciate just to

cover commissions and other expenses. In other words, it is the break-even point where a
customer may begin to see a return.
42.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, despite the fact that Customer 1 was in

her late 70s and had capital preservation as her investment objective, Ginn’s trading activity in
Customer 1’s account resulted in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of approximately 20.3
percent.
43.

Ginn did not discuss with Customer 1 the costs of his frequent trading in her

account.
44.

On many occasions, Ginn recommended that Customer 1 sell a position (or,

exercising discretion, Ginn sold a position in Customer 1’s account) shortly after purchasing it,
even though purchasing the position had caused the customer to pay a substantial commission.
45.

On February 3, 2021, for example, Ginn purchased 11,000 shares of a technology

company at $10.65 per share in Customer 1’s account, only to sell that position two days later at
a substantial loss for $8.46 per share. This roundtrip transaction generated $5,374 in
commissions. Two months later, on April 9, 2021, Ginn purchased 2,000 shares of the same
company at $13.34 per share.

6

46.

Ginn frequently engaged in such in-and-out trading when there had been

effectively no change in the share price. On March 9, 2021, for example, Ginn purchased 6,000
shares of a media company at $25.49 per share in Customer 1’s account, only to sell that position
16 days later at $25.46 per share. This round-trip transaction generated $7,643 in commissions,
which caused the customer to realize a loss of $7,810 even though the price of the security only
minimally decreased.
B. Ginn Churned and Excessively Traded Customer 2’s Account.
47.

Customer 2 was an 88-year-old retiree when she died in February 2022.

48.

Customer 2 first opened a trust account with IFG in 2015 while working with

Representative A.
49.

In or around 2016, Customer 2 was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

50.

Between January 2017 and December 2018, Representative A recommended and

executed fewer than two trades per month in Customer 2’s trust account.
51.

In July 2019, Ginn became the registered representative for Customer 2’s trust

account at IFG.
52.

Since at least September 2019, Customer 2’s sister acted as the trustee and

authorized customer contact on behalf of Customer 2 (“Customer 2’s Authorized Contact
Person”).
53.

In September 2019, Customer 2’s Authorized Contact Person completed an IFG

account update form for Customer 2’s account, indicating an investment objective of “growth &
income” and “moderate” risk tolerance.

7

54.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn recommended and effected 275

trades in Customer 2’s trust account, which resulted in approximately $570,000 in realized
losses.
55.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn’s trading activity in Customer 2’s

trust account resulted in Customer 2 paying trading costs of approximately $653,000, including
commissions of approximately $652,000.
56.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, and despite the fact that Customer 2 was

in her late 80s and had a moderate risk tolerance, Ginn’s trading activity in Customer 2’s trust
account resulted in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of approximately 23.4 percent.
57.

Ginn did not discuss with Customer 2 or her Authorized Contact the costs caused

by Ginn’s trading in Customer 2’s trust account.
58.

On many occasions, Ginn recommended that Customer 2 sell a position (or,

exercising discretion, Ginn sold a position in Customer 2’s account) shortly after purchasing it,
even though purchasing the position had caused the customer to pay a substantial commission.
Ginn frequently engaged in such in-and-out trading when there had been effectively no change in
the share price, even though the round-trip transaction caused the customer to pay a substantial
commission on both the buy and sell positions.
59.

On January 26, 2021, for example, Ginn purchased 20,000 shares of a

telecommunications company at $4.80 per share in Customer 2’s trust account, only to sell that
position nine days later on February 4, 2021, at $4.36 per share. This round-trip transaction
resulted in a loss to Customer 2 of $13,383, but generated $4,625 in commissions.
60.

Three months later, on May 20, 2021, Ginn purchased 20,000 shares of the same

telecommunications company in Customer 2’s trust account at $5.11 per share, only to sell that

8

position on June 18, 2021 at $5.13 per share. This round-trip transaction resulted in a loss of
$4,718 for Customer 2, but generated $5,118 in commissions.
61.

On September 16, 2020, Ginn purchased 1,000 shares of a technology company at

$68.17 per share in Customer 2’s trust account, only to sell that position 14 days later on
September 30, 2020 at $67.69 per share. This round-trip transaction resulted in a loss to
Customer 2 of $3,895 but generated $3,398 in commissions.
62.

Eight days later, on October 8, 2020, Ginn purchased 1,440 shares of the same

company in Customer 2’s trust account at $68.97 per share, only to sell that position on October
27, 2020 at $63.85 per share. This round-trip transaction resulted in a loss to Customer 2 of
$12,202, but generated $4,818 in commissions.
63.

On January 20, 2021, Ginn purchased 2,900 shares of the same company in

Customer 2’s trust account at $77.07 per share, only to sell that position seven days later on
January 27, 2021 at $74.49 per share. This round-trip transaction resulted in a loss to Customer 2
of $18,499, but generated $11,025 in commissions.
C. Ginn Churned and Excessively Traded Customer 3’s Account.
64.

Customer 3 is a 61-year-old civil engineer.

65.

Customer 3 first opened an account with IFG in 2015 while working with

Representative A.
66.

Between January 2017 and December 2018, Representative A recommended and

executed fewer than two trades per month in Customer 3’s account.
67.

account, indicating his investment objective of “income” and “moderate” risk tolerance.

9

68.

In July 2019, Ginn became the registered representative for Customer 3’s IRA

account at IFG.
69.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn recommended and effected 170

trades in Customer 3’s account, which resulted in approximately $147,000 in realized losses.
70.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn’s trading activity in Customer 3’s

account resulted in Customer 3 incurring total trading costs of approximately $189,000, nearly
all of which was commissions.
71.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, Ginn’s trading activity in Customer 3’s

account resulted in an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of approximately 20.3 percent.
72.

Ginn did not discuss with Customer 3 the costs caused by Ginn’s trading in

Customer 3’s account.
73.

On many occasions, Ginn recommended that Customer 3 sell a position (or,

exercising discretion, Ginn sold a position in Customer 3’s account) shortly after purchasing it,
even though purchasing the position had caused the customer to pay a substantial commission.
Ginn frequently engaged in such in-and-out trading when there had been effectively no change in
the share price, even though the round-trip transaction caused the customer to pay a substantial
commission on both the buy and sell positions.
74.

On May 20, 2021, for example, Ginn purchased, in Customer 3’s account, 14,000

shares of a telecommunications company at $5.10 per share, only to sell that position on June 17,
2021 at $5.20 per share. This round-trip transaction resulted in a loss of $2,181 for Customer 3,
but generated $3,597 in commissions.

technology company at $70.52 per share, only to sell that position 13 days later at $63.62 per

10

share. This round-trip transaction resulted in a loss of $2,196 for Customer 3, but generated $804
in commissions.
76.

On January 7, 2021, Ginn purchased 850 shares of the same company at $75.97

per share, only to sell that position six days later at $70.51 per share. This round-trip transaction
resulted in a loss of $7,788 for Customer 3, but generated $3,135 in commissions.
D. Ginn Churned and Excessively Traded Customer 4’s Account.
77.

Customer 4 is a 72-year-old retired police officer.

78.

Customer 4 first opened an IRA account with IFG in 2015 while working with

91.

Between January 2017 and December 2018, Representative A recommended and

executed fewer than three trades per month in Customer 5’s account.
92.

Beginning as early as April 2019, the two authorized contact persons for

Customer 5 were: (1) the dentist who ran the dental practice for which Customer 5 was the profit
sharing plan (“Customer 5’s Authorized Contact Person A”) and (2) the dentist’s mother
(“Customer 5’s Authorized Contact Person B”), who died in December 2022 at approximately 88
years old.
93.

In April 2019, Customer 5, acting through Customer 5’s Authorized Contact

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Churning
(Willful Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder, and
Violations of FINRA Rules 2020 and 2010)
104.

The Department of Enforcement realleges and incorporates by reference

paragraphs 1 through 103.
105.

Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act is an anti-fraud rule. It prohibits the use of

“any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance” in connection with the purchase or sale of
a security.
106.

Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 further prohibits: (a) employing “any device, scheme,

or artifice to defraud”; (b) making “any untrue statement of material fact or omit[ting] to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made… not misleading”; and
(c) engaging in “any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a
fraud or deceit upon any person.”
107.

FINRA Rule 2020 provides that “[n]o member shall effect any transaction in, or

induce the purchase or sale of, any security by means of any manipulative, deceptive or other
fraudulent device or contrivance.”
108.

FINRA Rule 2010 requires FINRA member firms and associated persons to

“observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade” in the
conduct of their business.
109.

Churning is fraudulent conduct that occurs in a broker-customer relationship

when: (a) a broker controls or exercises actual or de facto control over his customer’s account;
(b) the trading in the account is excessive in light of the customer’s investment profile; and (c)
the broker acts with scienter, i.e., with intent to defraud or with reckless disregard of the
customer’s interests.

15

110.

Churning is a manipulative and deceptive device that violates Section 10(b) of the

Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and FINRA Rules 2020 and 2010.
111.

From July 2020 through December 2022, Ginn exercised de facto control of the

trading in the accounts of Customer 1 through 5. Ginn controlled the volume and frequency of
trading in the accounts, he decided what securities to buy and sell, the quantity of each
transaction, and the timing of each transaction. Ginn also determined the commission he would
charge for each transaction. The customers relied on Ginn to make recommendations and
routinely followed Ginn’s recommendations. Ginn also frequently exercised discretion in the
accounts of Customers 1 through 4.
112.

Ginn’s trading in these five customers’ accounts was excessive and quantitatively

unsuitable for each of the customers based on their investment profiles, including Customer 1’s,
2’s, and 4’s ages, as evidenced by the high cost-to-equity ratios, the frequency of the
transactions, and the transaction costs incurred.
113.

For the period of July 2020 through December 2022, the accounts of Customers 1

through 5 experienced the following cost-to-equity ratios:
CUSTOMER
1
2
3
4
5
114.

COST-TO-EQUITY
RATIO (OVERALL)
50.8%
58.4%

67.7%

COST-TO-EQUITY
RATIO (ANNUALIZED)
20.3%
23.4%
20.3%
13.7%
27.1%

Ginn acted with scienter. In churning his customers’ accounts, Ginn acted with

intent to defraud or, at the very least, with reckless disregard of his customers’ interests, seeking
to maximize his own compensation in disregard of the interests of his customers. Ginn was

16

willfully blind to the trading costs he was imposing on the customers’ accounts and the resulting
losses. Ginn deliberately incurred unreasonably high trading costs in his customers’ accounts,
which made it virtually impossible for the accounts to be profitable. Indeed, Ginn’s trading in the
accounts of the five customers caused approximately $2.22 million in realized losses, while
generating commissions of more than $2.24 million for Ginn and IFG.
115.

Ginn’s fraudulent acts were carried out by the use or means of the

instrumentalities of interstate commerce and through the U.S. mail, and involved securities
transactions on national securities exchanges.
116.

As a result of the foregoing conduct, Ginn willfully violated Section 10(b) of the

Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and he violated FINRA Rules 2020 and 2010.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Excessive Trading
(Willful Violations of Exchange Act Rule 15l-1 Regulation Best Interest; Violations of
FINRA Rule 2010)
117.

The Department of Enforcement realleges and incorporates by reference

paragraphs 1 through 103 and paragraph 113.
118.

Since June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons have been

required to comply with Regulation BI under the Exchange Act. Regulation BI’s Best Interest
Obligation requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
securities (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best interest of
that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial or
other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person making the recommendation ahead of
the interest of the retail customer.

17

119.

Regulation BI defines a retail customer as “a natural person, or the legal

representative of such person, who: (i) Receives a recommendation of any securities transaction
or investment strategy involving securities from a broker or dealer; and (ii) Uses the
recommendation primarily for person, family, or household purposes.”
120.

A registered representative who conducts a trade on behalf of a customer without

the customer’s explicit authorization implicitly recommends the trade for that customer.
121.

For an associated person, the Best Interest Obligation is satisfied by compliance

with two obligations: (1) the Disclosure Obligation; and (2) the Care Obligation.
122.

Pursuant to the Care Obligation, as set forth in Exchange Act Rule 15l-

1(a)(2)(ii)(C), an associated person of a broker or dealer is required to exercise reasonable
diligence, care, and skill to:
Have a reasonable basis to believe that a series of recommended
transactions, even if in the retail customer’s best interest when viewed in
isolation, is not excessive and is in the retail customer’s best interest when
taken together in light of the retail customer’s investment profile and does
not place the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or such
natural person making the series of recommendations ahead of the interest
of the retail customer.
123.

The Care Obligation applies to a series of recommended transactions regardless of

whether the broker-dealer or associated person exercises control over the customer’s account.
124.

A violation of Regulation BI also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

125.

From July 2020 through December 2022, Ginn (a) made a series of

recommendations to Customers 1 through 4 without exercising reasonable diligence, care, and
skill to have a reasonable basis to believe that the series of recommended transactions were in the
best interests of those customers based on the customers’ investment profile and the potential
risks, rewards, and costs associated with the recommendations and (b) failed to exercise

18

reasonable diligence, care, and skill to understand the risks, rewards, and costs associated with
his short-term, high-cost trading strategy.
126.

Ginn’s trading in these four customers’ accounts was excessive for each of the

customers based on their investment profiles, including Customer 1’s, 2’s, and 4’s ages, as
evidenced by the high cost-to-equity ratios, the frequency of the transactions, and the transaction
costs incurred.
127.

At the time Ginn recommended the trades to Customers 1 through 4—all of

whom were retail investors—Ginn failed to consider the commission charges when deciding
what securities to buy and sell, how frequently to buy and sell securities, and what commissions
to charge. Ginn also failed to consider the effects of the cumulative trading costs and how those
commissions affected the value of each customer’s account.
128.

The series of recommendations that Ginn made to Customers 1 through 4 was

excessive and was not in those customers’ best interests and, when making that series of
recommendations, Ginn placed his interests ahead of the interests of those customers.
129.

Ginn’s failure to comply with Regulation Best Interest’s Care Obligation

constitutes a violation of Regulation Best Interest’s General Obligation.
130.

As a result of the foregoing conduct, Ginn willfully violated Exchange Act Rule

15l-1(a)(1) and violated FINRA Rule 2010.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Excessive Trading/Quantitative Suitability
(Violations of FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010)
131.

The Department of Enforcement realleges and incorporates by reference

paragraphs 1 through 103 and paragraph 113.
132.

FINRA Rule 2111(a) requires an associated person to:

19

have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or
investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the
customer, based on the information obtained through the reasonable
diligence of the member or associated person to ascertain the customer’s
investment profile. A customer’s investment profile includes, but is not
limited to, the customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and
needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience,
investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other
information the customer may disclose to the member or associated person
in connection with such recommendation.
133.

FINRA Rule 2111, Supplementary Material .05(c), provides as follows:
Quantitative suitability requires a member or associated person to have a
reasonable basis for believing that a series of recommended transactions,
even if suitable when viewed in isolation, are not excessive and unsuitable
for the customer when taken together in light of the customer’s investment
profile, as delineated in Rule 2111(a). No single test defines excessive
activity, but factors such as the turnover rate, the cost-equity ratio, and the
use of in-and-out trading in a customer's account may provide a basis for a
finding that a member or associated person has violated the quantitative
suitability obligation.

134.

A violation of FINRA Rule 2111 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

135.

Ginn’s trading in Customer 5’s accounts was excessive and quantitatively

unsuitable for Customer 5 based on its investment profile, as evidenced by the high cost-toequity ratios, the frequency of the transactions, and the transaction costs incurred.
136.

Ginn recommended a series of transactions to Customer 5 that was excessive and

quantitatively unsuitable in light of Customer 5’s investment profile.
137.

As a result of the foregoing conduct, Ginn violated FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unauthorized Use of Discretion
(Violations of FINRA Rules 3260 and 2010)

138.

The Department of Enforcement realleges and incorporates by reference

paragraphs 1 through 103.

20

139.

FINRA Rule 3260(b) prohibits a broker from using discretion in a customer’s

account without prior written authorization:
No member or registered representative shall exercise any discretionary
power in a customer’s account unless such customer has given prior
written authorization to a stated individual or individuals and the account
has been accepted by the member, as evidenced in writing by the member
or the partner, officer or manager, duly designated by the member, in
accordance with Rule 3110.
140.

A violation of FINRA Rule 3260 is also a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

141.

IFG’s WSPs did not permit Ginn to exercise discretionary power in any

customer’s account.
142.

Ginn did not have prior written authorization to exercise discretionary power in

the accounts of Customers 1 through 4.
143.

Ginn was responsible for entering the trades in the accounts of Customers 1

through 4 and for obtaining these customers’ authorization for trading activity.
144.

Ginn entered hundreds of trades in the accounts of Customers 1 through 4 without

obtaining prior authorization from these customers.
145.

As a result of the foregoing conduct, Ginn violated FINRA Rule 3260 and FINRA

Rule 2010.
