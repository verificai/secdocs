RE:

Jose M. Candelario Padilla (Respondent)
General Securities Representative
CRD No. 4847560

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Jose M. Candelario Padilla submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Candelario Padilla first became registered with FINRA in 2004. Since September 2016,
he has been registered as a General Securities Representative through an association with
Nationwide Planning Associates Inc. (CRD No. 31029). 1
OVERVIEW
Between March 2020 and October 2020, Candelario Padilla recommended retail
customers purchase leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds (NT-ETFs) without
having a sufficient understanding of the risks and features associated with the products,
thereby failing to have a reasonable basis to make those recommendations. As a result,
Candelario Padilla willfully violated the Care Obligation under Rule 15l-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Regulation BI or Reg BI) and violated FINRA Rules
2111 and 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from an examination of Nationwide Planning Associates.

As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation BI under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Reg BI requires a broker,
dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when making a
recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities
(including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best interest of
that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial
or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the interest of the
retail customer. Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii),
requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence,
care, and skill to, among other things, understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs
associated with a recommendation, and have a reasonable basis to believe that the
recommendation could be in the best interest of at least some retail customers. Reg BI’s
Adopting Release provides that what constitutes “reasonable diligence, care and skill”
depends on, among other things, the complexity of, and risks associated with, the
recommended security. 2
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 required members and associated persons to
have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy
involving a security or securities is suitable for the retail customer. Rule 2111
Supplementary Material .05(a) defines the reasonable-basis obligation to require
members and their associated persons perform reasonable diligence to have an
understanding of the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended
security or strategy, and to have a reasonable basis to believe, based on that reasonable
diligence, that the recommendation is suitable for at least some investors.
A violation of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 2111 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires associated persons to “observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade” in the conduct of their business.
NT-ETFs are designed to return a multiple of an underlying index or benchmark, the
inverse of that benchmark, or both, over only the course of one trading session—usually a
single day. NT-ETFs typically rebalance their portfolios on a daily basis (also known as
the daily reset). As a result, due to the effects of compounding of daily returns during the
holding period, the performance of NT-ETFs over periods longer than a single trading
session can differ significantly from the performance of their underlying index or
benchmark during the same period of time. In Regulatory Notice 09-31, FINRA advised
its members that before recommending the purchase of an NT-ETF, a firm and its
associated persons must understand the terms and features of the funds, including, in part,
the effect that a customer’s intended holding period will have on the funds’ performance.
This Notice also advises that NT-ETFs “typically are not suitable for retail investors who
plan to hold them for more than one trading session, particularly in volatile markets.”
Between March 2020 and October 2020, Candelario Padilla recommended that retail
customers at Nationwide Planning Associates purchase NT-ETFs. When he made those

recommendations, Candelario Padilla did not have a sufficient understanding of the
features and risks associated with NT-ETFs—including, for example, that losses in NTETFs can be compounded because of the daily reset function. As a result, Candelario
Padilla did not have a reasonable basis to believe that NT-ETFs could be suitable for or in
the best interest of any retail customers.
At Candelario Padilla’s recommendation, nine retail customers held a total of 14 NT-ETF
positions for periods ranging from 14 to 65 days. These customers suffered net losses
from NT-ETF trading of approximately $26,000.
Therefore, Candelario Padilla willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1 (for conduct on
and after June 30, 2020), FINRA Rule 2111 (for conduct prior to June 30, 2020), and
FINRA Rule 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:


a three-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all
capacities;



a $2,500 fine; and



restitution of $26,422 plus interest as described below.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which he proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this AWC
(Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $26,422, plus interest at the rate set forth in
Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), from October
13, 2020 until the date this AWC is accepted by the National Adjudicatory Council
(NAC).
Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment of restitution and interest
(separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each Eligible Customer) or of
reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution. Such proof shall be
submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org. The email must identify
Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order, or other
method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.
The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
3

AWC, Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not unacceptable to
FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanctions in this AWC, and
the timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their
own actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Respondent understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member, he becomes subject to a statutory disqualification as that term is defined
in Article III, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, incorporating Section 3(a)(39) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, he may not be associated with any
FINRA member in any capacity, including clerical or ministerial functions, during the
period of the bar or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that he willfully violated
Rule 15l-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that under Article III, Section 4 of
FINRA’s By-Laws, this makes him subject to a statutory disqualification with respect to
association with a member.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:
A.

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against him;

B.

To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
4

person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including

that is inconsistent with the AWC in this statement. This statement does not
