RE:

Kayan Securities, Inc. (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 156175
Yong Soo Kim (Respondent)
General Securities Principal
CRD No. 1747849

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondents Kayan Securities and Yong Soo Kim (Kim) submit
this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement
of the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondents alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondents accept and consent to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Kayan has been a FINRA member firm since November 2011. Headquartered in Los
Angeles, California, the firm has two branch offices and 14 registered representatives.
The firm engages in a general securities business.
Kim first became associated with a FINRA member firm in 1987. Since November 2011,
Kim has been registered with FINRA as a General Securities Representative and General
Securities Principal through an association with Kayan. Kim is the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Compliance Officer of Kayan. In December 1998, Kim entered into an
AWC with NASD and agreed to pay a $2,500 fine jointly and severally with a prior firm
regarding violations of NASD Rules 1120(b) and 2110 for training and continuing
education lapses by the firm. In April 2013, Kim entered into an AWC with FINRA and
agreed to pay a $5,000 fine regarding violations of NASD Rule 2420 and FINRA Rule
2010 for sharing commissions with an unregistered person. In January 2020, a customer
won a FINRA arbitration award against Kim, who was found jointly and severally liable
for the customer’s losses, and ordered to pay $12,757 after the customer made allegations

of breach of contract, errors/charges, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, churning, lack
of suitability, unauthorized trading, and indemnification. 1
OVERVIEW
From January 2018 through at least April 2021, Kayan and Kim failed to establish,
maintain, and enforce a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures
(WSPs), reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the suitability requirements of
FINRA Rule 2111 and the Care Obligation of Rule 15l-1 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (Regulation BI or Reg BI) 2 as they pertain to excessive trading, in violation of
FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. As of June 30, 2020, Kayan also violated Reg BI’s
Compliance Obligation by not establishing, maintaining, and enforcing WSPs reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.
From January 2018 through April 2021, Kayan and Kim also failed to reasonably
supervise a former firm registered representative (Representative 1), by failing to respond
to red flags that Representative 1 had engaged in unauthorized and excessive trading in
three customers’ accounts, in violation of FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. 3
From September 2019 through the present, Kayan also failed to disclose to FINRA two
written customer complaints regarding Representative 1 and the firm’s conclusion that
Representative 1 had violated FINRA rules, in violation of FINRA Rules 4530 and 2010.
From September 2019 through the present, the firm also failed to update Representative
1’s Forms U4 and U5 regarding three written customer complaints, in violation of Article
V, Sections 2(c) and 3(b) of FINRA’s By-Laws and FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
A. Kayan and Kim failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system
and WSPs reasonably designed to achieve compliance with SEC and FINRA
rules regarding excessive trading.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Reg BI. Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of Reg BI requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person
associated with a broker or dealer, when making a recommendation of any securities
transaction or investment strategy involving securities (including account
recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best interest of that retail customer at
the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial or other interest of
the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the interest of the retail customer.
For more information about Respondents Kayan and Kim, including prior regulatory events involving Kim, visit
BrokerCheck® at www finra.org/brokercheck.

1

The compliance date for Reg BI was June 30, 2020. Also, effective June 30, 2020, FINRA amended Rule 2111 to
state that Rule 2111 will not apply to recommendations subject to Reg BI.

2

3
In April 2021, Representative 1 entered into an AWC with FINRA in which he was barred for unauthorized trading
and providing false information to FINRA, in violation of FINRA Rules 2010 and 8210.

2

Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires
broker-dealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and
skill to, among other things, have a reasonable basis to believe that a series of
recommended transactions, even if in the retail customer’s best interest when viewed in
isolation, is not excessive and is in the retail customer’s best interest in light of the retail
customer’s investment profile.
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 required members and associated persons to
have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation of a transaction or investment
strategy involving a security or securities to any customer is suitable for the customer.
Under Rule 2111.05(c), members and associated persons with actual or de facto control
over an account were required to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of
recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, are not excessive
and unsuitable for the customer in light of the customer's investment profile. FINRA
Rule 2111 is still in effect, but as of June 30, 2020, it no longer applies to
recommendations that are subject to Reg BI, and the element of control was removed
from the quantitative suitability component.
No single test defines when trading is excessive, but factors such as the turnover rate, the
cost-to-equity ratio, and the use of in-and-out trading in a customer’s account are relevant
to determining whether a member firm or associated person has excessively traded a
customer’s account in violation of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 2111. The turnover rate
represents the number of times that a portfolio of securities is exchanged for another
portfolio of securities. The cost-to-equity ratio measures the amount an account must
appreciate just to cover commissions and other expenses. In other words, it is the breakeven point where a customer may begin to see a return. A turnover rate of six or more, or
a cost-to-equity ratio above 20 percent, generally indicates that a series of recommended
transactions was excessive.
Additionally, Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act
Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(iv), requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI,
including the Care Obligation. Reg BI’s Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers
should consider the nature of that firm’s operations and how to design such policies and
procedures to prevent violations from occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and
to correct promptly any violations that have occurred. 4
FINRA Rule 3110 requires member firms to establish, maintain, and enforce a
supervisory system, including written procedures, to supervise the activities of each
associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable
securities laws, regulations, and FINRA rules.

at 33397 (July 12, 2019).

Violations of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 3110 also are violations of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires associated persons to “observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade” in the conduct of their business.
From January 2018 through at least April 2021, Kayan’s supervisory system and WSPs
were not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 2111 or the Care
Obligation of Reg BI as they pertain to excessive trading. The firm’s WSPs during this
period identified Kim as the designated principal responsible for supervising for
potentially unsuitable and excessive trading.
During this period, Kayan’s supervisory system for detecting and investigating potential
excessive trading consisted of Kim reviewing representatives’ daily order logs and
monthly active trading reports he received from Kayan’s clearing firm. The monthly
active trading reports included information about account turnover rates and commissionto-equity ratios.
Until September 2018, Kayan’s WSPs required Kim to monitor for undefined
“questionable” or “exceptional” activity to identify excessive trading, among other types
of trading misconduct, without describing any process for doing so, for example by
referencing the turnover rate or cost/commission-to-equity ratio. The firm’s WSPs during
this period also required Kim to send letters to customers if he detected undefined
“exceptions.” These letters were to identify the trading activities which triggered the
issuance of the letter and to confirm the customer’s awareness of those activities;
however, the firm’s letters failed to do either of those things. In September 2018 and July
2019, respectively, the firm added commission-to-equity ratio and turnover rate
benchmarks to its WSPs regarding excessive trading monitoring. The WSPs further
required that Kim was required to send a letter to a customer and have them sign an
“Active Trading Account Review” form whenever trading in their account exceeded the
turnover rate or commission-to-equity ratio benchmarks. However, the letter and related
form did not identify any transactions or confirm the customers’ awareness about any
specific trading activity.
In July 2020, the firm updated its WSPs to add sections regarding Reg BI and the Care
Obligation, but did not add to or revise its WSPs regarding excessive trading supervision.
Therefore, from January 2018 through at least April 2021, Kayan and Kim violated
FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010, and from June 30, 2020 through at least April 2021, Kayan
also violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1).
B. Kayan and Kim failed to reasonably supervise Representative 1.
The duty to supervise under Rule 3110 requires member firms and their principals to
reasonably investigate red flags that suggest misconduct may be occurring and to act
upon the results of such investigation.

4

Unauthorized trading occurs when a registered representative effects trades in a
customer’s non-discretionary account without first obtaining the customer’s authorization
or consent. Unauthorized trading is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
Between January 2018 through April 2021, Kim was Representative 1’s direct supervisor
and was responsible for reviewing and supervising his trading activity. As described
below, Kayan and Kim identified, or should have identified, red flags indicating that
Representative 1 was engaged in unauthorized and excessive trading in the accounts of
Customer 1, Customer 2 (who was a senior), and Customer 3, but failed to reasonably
respond to these red flags.
Specifically, Kayan and Kim were aware of, or should have been aware of, the following
red flags of Representative 1’s potentially unauthorized and excessive trading:
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Kayan’s clearing firm designated Customer 1’s account as a “pattern day trader”
account, suggesting a high volume of daily trading.
Kayan’s clearing firm’s active trading reports in 2018, 2019 and 2020 indicated
that the three customers’ accounts had turnover rates above the recognized
excessive trading benchmark of six.
Representative 1 consistently executed in-and-out trading in the three customers’
accounts in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which is a pattern of buying and selling the
same security multiple times in a short period of time. Further, he engaged in such
trading in primarily the same single stock in the accounts of Customer 1 and
Customer 3 in 2018 and 2019, and in a different single stock in Customer 2’s
account in 2020.
Representative 1 designated nearly all of the transactions at issue in the three
customers’ accounts as “unsolicited,” indicating that the three customers had
asked Representative 1 to execute all the specific transactions in their accounts.
Customer 1 lost $393,969 as a result of Representative 1’s trading activity.
Customer 1 complained about Representative 1’s unauthorized trading to the firm
in June 2019.
Customer 2 complained about Representative 1’s unauthorized trading to the firm
in September 2020.

Kayan and Kim failed to reasonably respond to these red flags. Kim never contacted
Customer 1 or Customer 3. After Customer 1 complained about Representative 1’s
trading to the firm in June 2019, Kayan and Kim did not reasonably investigate the
trading activity.
When Representative 1 engaged in similar trading in Customer 3’s account in 2019, Kim
only had Representative 1 obtain a revised account application from Customer 3,
changing the investment objective and risk tolerance to conform to the trading. Then,
when Representative 1 engaged in similar trading in Customer 2’s account in 2020, Kim
waited until the account appeared on three monthly active account reports with a turnover
rate above six before sending a letter to Customer 2 regarding his account activity, to
which Customer 2 immediately responded and complained about unauthorized trading.
5

In September 2020, after Representative 1 admitted to Kim that he had engaged in
unauthorized trading in Customer 1’s and Customer 2’s accounts, the firm fined
Representative 1 for unauthorized trading in Customer 2’s account. The firm, however,
conducted no further investigation and allowed Representative 1 to continue to trade in
other customers’ accounts until he was barred by FINRA in April 2021. After
Representative 1 was barred, Customer 3 notified the firm that Representative 1 had
engaged in unauthorized trading in his account as well.
Based on the foregoing, from January 2018 through April 2021, Kayan and Kim failed to
reasonably supervise the trading activities of Representative 1 by failing to reasonably
respond to red flags indicative of unauthorized and excessive trading.
Therefore, Kayan and Kim violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
C. Kayan failed to disclose to FINRA two customer complaints or its conclusion
that Representative 1 had engaged in unauthorized trading.
FINRA Rule 4530(d) requires each member firm to “report to FINRA statistical and
summary information regarding written customer complaints . . . by the 15th day of the
month following the calendar quarter in which customer complaints are received by the
member.” 5 FINRA Rule 4530(b) requires that member firms report to FINRA “not later
than 30 calendar days, after the member has concluded or reasonably should have
concluded that an associated person of the member or the member itself has violated any
securities-, insurance-, commodities-, financial- or investment-related laws, rules,
regulations or standards of conduct of any domestic or foreign regulatory body or selfregulatory organization.” FINRA uses the information received pursuant to Rule 4530 for
regulatory purposes to identify and initiate investigations of member firms, associated
persons, and others that may pose a risk to investors.
A violation of Rule 4530 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
In September 2019, Customer 1 sent a written complaint to Kayan regarding
Representative 1’s trading activities in his account. In January 2021, Customer 2 also sent
a written complaint to Kayan regarding Representative 1’s trading activities in his
account. Both complaints met the requirements for mandatory reporting under
Rule 4530(d). However, Kayan never reported to FINRA either of these customers’
complaints.
Moreover, in September 2020, Kayan concluded that Representative 1 had engaged in
unauthorized trading in Customer 1 and 2’s account, based, in part, on Representative 1’s
admission that he had done so. However, Kayan failed to report to FINRA that it had
concluded Representative 1 had engaged in unauthorized trading in at least two
customers’ accounts over a period of approximately three years.
To comply with Rule 4530(d), members must report any written grievance by a customer if the grievance concerns
the member or an associated person of the member. FINRA Rule 4530 Supplementary Material .08.

5

6

Therefore, Kayan violated FINRA Rules 4530 and 2010.
D. Kayan failed to update Representative 1’s Form U4 and Form U5.
Pursuant to Article V, Section 2 of FINRA’s By-Laws, when any person applies to be
registered with FINRA, the member firm must file a Form U4 containing certain
disclosures, such as customer complaints involving the person. Article V, Section 2(c) of
FINRA’s By-Laws requires that member firms keep every Form U4 filed with FINRA
current at all times by filing amendments no later than 30 days after learning of facts or
circumstances giving rise to the amendment. Article V, Section 3 of FINRA’s By-Laws
requires each member firm, not later than 30 days after termination of the association of
any person, to give notice to FINRA of such termination by filing a Form U5. Article V,
Section 3(b) of FINRA’s By-Laws requires that member firms, in the event they learn of
facts or circumstances causing any information in a Form U5 filed with FINRA to
become inaccurate or incomplete, to file amendments no later than 30 days after learning
of facts or circumstances giving rise to the amendment. FINRA Rule 1122 also prohibits
member firms from filing with FINRA information with respect to registration that is
incomplete or inaccurate so as to be misleading or could in any way tend to mislead and
requires member firms to correct any such filing. Failing to amend or to timely amend
Forms U4 or U5 to disclose reportable investment-related customer complaints violates
Article V, Section 2 and 3 of FINRA’s By-Laws, and FINRA Rules 1122.
A violation of Article V, Sections 2 and 3 of FINRA’s By-Laws and FINRA Rule 1122
also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
Question 14I(3) of Form U4, and Question 7E(3) of Form U5, require disclosure of any
written customer complaint that alleges that the person was involved in sales practice
violations and which contain a claim for compensatory damages of at least $5,000. 6
Nonetheless, Kayan failed to update Representative 1’s Form U4 and Form U5 to report
three written customer complaints alleging Representative 1’s involvement in sales
practice violations, specifically: (1) Customer 1’s written complaint in September 2019;
(2) Customer 2’s written complaint in January 2021; and (3) a second written complaint
by Customer 2 in April 2021.
Therefore, Kayan violated Article V, Section 2(c) and 3(b) of FINRA’s By-Laws, and
FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010.
B.

Respondents also consent to the imposition of the following sanctions:


Kayan consents to:
o a censure;

If no damage amount is alleged, the complaint must be reported unless the firm has made a good faith
determination that the damages from the alleged conduct would be less than $5,000.

6

7

o partial restitution of $50,000, 7 plus interest, as described below; and
o an undertaking that, within 90 days of the date of the Notice of Acceptance of
this AWC, a member of Kayan’s senior management who is a registered
principal of the firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the
certification, the firm has reviewed and remediated the issues identified in the
AWC, and implemented a supervisory system, including written supervisory
procedures, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with SEC and FINRA
rules regarding excessive trading. The certification shall include a narrative
description and supporting exhibits sufficient to demonstrate Kayan’s
remediation and implementation. FINRA staff may request further evidence of
Kayan’s remediation and implementation, and Kayan agrees to provide such
evidence. Kayan shall submit the certification to John Sheehan, Senior
Counsel, FINRA Department of Enforcement, at 100 Pine Street, Suite 1800,
San Francisco, CA 94111, or electronically to John.Sheehan@finra.org, with a
copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. Upon written request showing good
cause, FINRA staff may extend this deadline.


Kim consents to:
o a two-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all
principal capacities;
o a $5,000 fine; and
o an undertaking that within 90 days of the Notice of Acceptance of this AWC,
Kim will attend and satisfactorily complete 20 hours of continuing education
concerning supervisory responsibilities, including supervision relating to
unauthorized and excessive trading, by a provider not unacceptable to FINRA.
Kim will notify John Sheehan, Senior Counsel, of the name and contact
information of the provider of the continuing education at least 10 days prior
to attending the continuing education. Within 30 days following the
completion of the continuing education, Kim will submit written proof that the
continuing education program was satisfactorily completed to John Sheehan at
John.Sheehan@finra.org. All correspondence must identify Kim and the case
number 2019064935602. Upon written request showing good cause, FINRA
may extend any of the deadlines related to the continuing education
component of the sanction.

Respondent Kayan is ordered to pay partial restitution to the customer listed on
Attachment A to this AWC (Eligible Customer) in the total amount of $50,000, plus
interest at the rate set forth in Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.
§ 6621(a)(2), starting from the date this AWC is accepted by the National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC) until payment is made.
7

Pursuant to the General Principles Applicable to all Sanction Determinations contained in FINRA’s Sanction
Guidelines, FINRA imposed partial restitution and no fine after considering, among other things, Kayan’s revenues
and financial resources.

8

A registered principal on behalf of Kayan has submitted a statement of financial
condition and demonstrated an inability to pay full restitution immediately upon issuance
of the AWC. In light of the financial status of Kayan, restitution to the Eligible Customer
shall be payable on the schedule and in the amounts listed on Attachment A, commencing
with the first payment to be made on the 15th day of the month following the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.
A registered principal on behalf of Kayan shall submit satisfactory proof of payment of
restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to the
Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect
restitution after each payment due under the installment plan. Such proof shall be
submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org. from a work-related account of
the registered principal of Kayan. The email must identify Kayan and the case number
and include a copy of the check, money order, or other method of payment. This proof
shall be provided by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 15 days after
each payment is due.
The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to the Eligible Customer shall be treated
by Kayan as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Kayan is unable to pay the Eligible
Customer within 15 days after each payment is due, Kayan shall submit to FINRA in the
manner described above a description of Kayan’s plan, not unacceptable to FINRA, to
comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned property, or
similar laws for the Eligible Customer.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanction in this AWC, and the
timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their own
actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.
Respondents Kayan and Kim agree to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this
AWC has been accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Kim has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which he proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondents Kayan and Kim specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim an
inability to pay, now or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary
sanctions imposed in this matter.
Respondent Kim understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member in a principal capacity, he becomes subject to a statutory disqualification
as that term is defined in Article III, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, incorporating
9

Section 3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, Kim may not be
associated with any FINRA member in any principal capacity, during the period of the
bar or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311. Furthermore, because Kim is
subject to a statutory disqualification during the suspension, if he remains associated with
a member firm in a non-suspended capacity, an application to continue that association
may be required.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS
Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:
A.

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against them;

B.

To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

C.

To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision

Appeals.

Further, Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.
Respondents further specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.
