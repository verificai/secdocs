RE:

Independent Financial Group, LLC (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 7717

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Independent Financial Group, LLC (IFG) submits
this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement
of the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
IFG, along with its predecessor firms, has been a FINRA member firm and registered
with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) since 1978. IFG is
headquartered in San Diego, California. IFG has approximately 650 registered
representatives and 380 branch offices.1
OVERVIEW
From September 2015 to the present, IFG failed to establish and maintain a supervisory
system reasonably designed to supervise registered representatives’ recommendations to
customers that they rollover 529 savings plan investments from one state plan to another.
Specifically, IFG did not have policies or procedures regarding available sales charge
waivers or special share classes that decreased the cost of 529 plan rollover transactions.
Although IFG revised its written supervisory procedures in May 2022 to address 529 plan
rollover transactions, the procedures failed to articulate the firm’s policy for providing
customers with available sales charge waivers or special share classes. Further, although
IFG initiated training in 2023 on the potential availability of 529 plan rollover sales
charge waivers, the training similarly failed to articulate the firm’s policy for providing
customers with those waivers. Some customers who were eligible for waivers did not

receive them. Therefore, Respondent violated MSRB Rule G-27. As of June 30, 2020,
Respondent also violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) (“Reg BI”), specifically, Reg
BI’s Compliance Obligation.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from a FINRA review of whether eligible customers who rolled
their 529 plans from one state plan to another were receiving available front-end sales
charge waivers or Class AR shares.
Background—529 Plans
529 plans are tax-advantaged municipal securities that are designed to encourage saving
for the future educational expenses of a designated beneficiary.2 529 plans are sponsored
by states, state agencies, or educational institutions. All fifty states and the District of
Columbia sponsor at least one type of 529 plan. States offer 529 plans either directly,
through designated broker-dealers, or both.
Shares of 529 plans are sold in different classes with different fee structures.3 Class A
shares typically impose a front-end sales charge but charge lower annual fees compared
to other classes. Class C shares typically impose no front-end sales charge but impose
higher annual fees than Class A shares.
Some 529 plan product sponsors waive sales charges for investors who roll their current
529 plan from one state’s 529 plan into another state’s 529 plan, either by waiving the
sales charges on Class A shares or by offering a special share class, Class AR, which is
meant specifically for 529 plan state-to-state rollovers and has no upfront sales charge.
Class AR shares are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge within the first year
and, initially, have annual fees similar to a Class C share but convert to Class A shares
after a predefined length of time, usually one year.
The different sales charges, waivers, and fees associated with 529 plans affect customers’
investment returns. If a customer qualifies for a Class A sales charge waiver or a Class
AR share as a result of a rollover, he or she would not pay the front-end sales charge
traditionally associated with new Class A share purchases. In contrast, a purchase of a
Class C share of the same fund will be subject to higher ongoing fees. Therefore, if a
rollover customer qualifies for a Class A sales charge waiver or a Class AR share, there
likely would be no justification for that customer to purchase a class of shares that has a
sales load and/or higher annual expenses.

2

529 plans are named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 529), which grants tax-exempt
status to qualified education expenses.

3

A 529 plan is structured as a trust. A customer purchases “units” in the trust. For purposes of this AWC, the terms
“unit” and “share” are used interchangeably.

The Applicable Rules Relating to 529 Plan Share-Class Recommendations
Because 529 plans are municipal securities, the sales of 529 plans are governed by the
rules of the MSRB.
Prior to June 30, 2020, MSRB Rule G-19 required a broker, dealer or municipal
securities dealer to have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction
was suitable for the customer based on the customer’s investment profile, which included
a customer’s investment objectives. As of June 30, 2020, Rule G-19 applies only to
recommendations to which Reg BI does not apply.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Reg BI. Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person
associated with a broker or dealer, when making a recommendation of any securities
transaction or investment strategy involving securities (including account
recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best interest of that retail customer at
the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial or other interest of
the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the interest of the retail customer. Reg
BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires brokerdealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to,
among other things, understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with a
recommendation.
MSRB Rule G-27(a) requires brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers to
supervise the conduct of their municipal securities activities to ensure compliance with
MSRB rules and applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Exchange Act rules. MSRB Rule G-27(b) requires brokers, dealers, and municipal
securities dealers to establish and maintain a system to supervise the municipal securities
activities of each registered representative, registered principal, and other associated
person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws
and regulations, and with applicable MSRB rules. MSRB Rule G-27(c) requires brokers,
dealers, and municipal securities dealers to adopt, maintain, and enforce written
supervisory procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with MSRB Rule G27(a).
Additionally, Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule
15l-1(a)(2)(iv), requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI, including the
Care Obligation. The Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers should consider the
nature of that firm’s operations and how to design such policies and procedures to
prevent violations from occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and to correct
promptly any violations that have occurred.4

Respondent’s 529 Plan Rollover Supervision Was Not Reasonable
From September 2015 through the present, Respondent’s system for supervising
representatives’ 529 plan rollover recommendations was not reasonably designed. Since
at least September 2015, Respondent made available to customers numerous 529 plans,
each of which, at some time during that time period, implemented a Class A sales charge
waiver for state-to-state rollovers.
From September 2015 through May 2022, Respondent’s policies and procedures,
including its written supervisory procedures, did not alert registered representatives who
recommended 529 plan state-to-state rollovers of the potential availability of Class A
sales charge waivers or Class AR shares for 529 plan rollovers. The firm also did not
offer training to registered representatives regarding sales charge waivers or the
availability of Class AR shares. Further, Respondent failed to provide supervisors with
guidance or training on how to review recommended 529 plan rollover transactions to
identify instances where there might have been an available Class A sales charge waivers
or Class AR shares.
In May 2022, Respondent revised its written supervisory procedures to address the
potential availability of Class A sales charge waivers and Class AR shares for 529 plan
rollovers. Although these revised procedures direct representatives to confirm with the
applicable plan sponsor if a client is entitled to a sales charge waiver or Class AR share
when completing a 529 plan state-to-state rollover, they fail to articulate the firm’s policy
regarding whether to provide customers with a sales charge waiver or Class AR share.
Further, the revised written supervisory procedures do not establish any system for
monitoring and reviewing the application of available sales charge waivers or Class AR
shares for eligible customers. Starting in 2023, the firm first provided training that
apprised representatives of the potential availability of sales charge waivers for 529 plan
rollovers. However, the training materials did not address the firm’s policy or information
regarding whether to provide customers with a sales charge waiver or Class AR share.
As a result, from September 2015 through the present, Respondent failed to consistently
apply available sales charge waivers, impacting at least 18 customers in which total
rollover dollars totaled at least $837,000. This resulted in at least $17,000 in sales charges
and fees that, had the waiver been granted, would not have been charged.
Therefore, from September 2015 to the present, Respondent violated MSRB Rule G-27.
From June 30, 2020 to the present, Respondent violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:


a censure;



a $75,000 fine ($50,000 of which pertains to the violation of MSRB Rule G-27);



the firm will pay restitution plus interest to current and former customers who,
from September 1, 2015, to the date of the acceptance of this AWC, qualified for,
4

but did not receive, the applicable sales charge waivers or Class AR shares in
connection with recommended state-to-state 529 rollovers (“Eligible Customers”)
in an amount to be determined by a Third-Party Consultant as described below;
and


an undertaking to do the following:
a. Continue to retain, at its own expense, the Third-Party Consultant5 to
conclude performance of the following tasks:
i. Conduct a comprehensive review of the adequacy of Respondent’s
compliance with MSRB Rule G-27 and Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation,
including but not limited to a review of Respondent’s written supervisory
procedures, controls and training related to the application of sales charge
waivers or Class AR shares in connection with 529 plan rollover
recommendations;
ii. Identify which customers are Eligible Customers as defined above; and
iii. Calculate the amount of restitution owed to each Eligible Customer.
b. Cooperate with the Third-Party Consultant in all respects, including providing
the Third-Party Consultant with access to Respondent’s files, books, records,
and personnel, as reasonably requested for the above-mentioned review.
Respondent shall require the Third-Party Consultant to report to FINRA on its
activities as FINRA may request and shall place no restrictions on the ThirdParty Consultant’s communications with FINRA. Further, upon request,
Respondent shall make available to FINRA any and all communications
between the Third-Party Consultant and Respondent and documents examined
by the Third-Party Consultant in connection with this review.
c. Refrain from terminating the relationship with the Third-Party Consultant
without FINRA’s written approval. Respondent shall not be in and shall not
have an attorney-client relationship with the Third-Party Consultant and shall
not seek to invoke the attorney-client privilege or other doctrine or privilege to
prevent the Third-Party Consultant from transmitting any information, reports,
or documents to FINRA.
d. Require the Third-Party Consultant to submit an initial written report to
Respondent and FINRA at the conclusion of the Third-Party Consultant’s
review, which shall be no more than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of this AWC. The initial report shall, at a minimum: (i) evaluate

5

Respondent has already engaged a third-party outside consultant (the Third-Party Consultant) to review the
adequacy of Respondent’s compliance with MSRB Rule G-27 and Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation (including but
not limited to Respondent’s written supervisory procedures, controls and training related to sales charge waivers or
Class AR shares in connection with 529 plan rollover recommendations), identify Eligible Customers, and calculate
the amount of restitution owed to Eligible Customers.

5

and address the adequacy of Respondent’s written supervisory procedures,
controls, and training concerning sales charge waivers or Class AR shares on
529 plan rollovers; (ii) provide a description of the review performed and the
conclusions reached; (iii) make recommendations as may be needed regarding
how Respondent should modify or supplement its processes, controls,
policies, systems, procedures, and training to manage its regulatory and other
risks in relation to compliance with MSRB Rule G-27 and Reg BI’s
Compliance Obligation; (iv) identify the Eligible Customers (as defined
above); and (v) calculate the amount of restitution owed to each Eligible
Customer using a methodology not unacceptable to FINRA.
i. Within 60 days after delivery of the initial report, Respondent shall adopt
and implement the recommendations of the Third-Party Consultant or, if
Respondent considers a recommendation to be, in whole or in part, unduly
burdensome or impractical, propose alternative recommendations to the
Third-Party Consultant designed to achieve the same objective.
Respondent shall submit such proposed alternative recommendations in
writing simultaneously to the Third-Party Consultant and FINRA.
ii. Respondent shall require that, within 30 days of Respondent’s submission
of any proposed alternative procedure, the Third-Party Consultant: (A)
reasonably evaluate the alternative procedure and determine whether it
will achieve the same objective as the Third-Party Consultant’s original
recommendation; and (B) provide Respondent and FINRA with a written
report reflecting the Third-Party Consultant’s evaluation and
determination. In the event the Third-Party Consultant and Respondent are
unable to agree, Respondent must abide by the Third-Party Consultant’s
ultimate determination with respect to any proposed alternative procedure
and must adopt and implement all recommendations deemed appropriate
by the Third-Party Consultant.
Implementation of Third-Party Consultant’s Supervisory
Recommendations
iii. Within 60 days after the issuance of the later of the Third-Party
Consultant’s initial report or the Third-Party Consultant’s ultimate
determination with respect to any proposed alternative recommendation,
Respondent shall provide the Third-Party Consultant and FINRA with a
written implementation report, certified by an officer of Respondent,
attesting to, containing documentation of, and setting forth the details of
Respondent’s implementation of the Third-Party Consultant’s
recommendations. The certification shall identify the undertakings,
provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be
supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. FINRA may
make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence.
6

Payment of Restitution to Eligible Customers
iv. Within 60 days after the issuance of the later of the Third-Party
Consultant’s initial report or the Third-Party Consultant’s ultimate
determination with respect to any proposed alternative recommendation,
the Firm shall remit to each Eligible Customer restitution consistent with
the Third-Party Consultant’s initial report or ultimate determination with
respect to any proposed alternative recommendation, plus interest at the
rate set forth in Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), with interest amounts to be calculated based on the
date that the excess charges and fees for each respective customer were
incurred until the date of the acceptance of the AWC.
v. A registered principal on behalf of Respondent shall submit satisfactory
proof of payment of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date
and amount of each paid to each Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution. Such proof shall be
submitted to Elissa Meth Kestin either (1) by letter that identifies
Respondent and the case number and includes copies of the checks, money
orders or other methods of payment or (2) by e-mail, with .pdf copies of
the payment documentation, from a work-related account of a registered
principal of Respondent to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org. This proof
shall be provided to the FINRA staff member listed above no later than 60
days from the date on which the firm issued the restitution payments to
Eligible Customers.
vi. The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer
shall be treated by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for
purposes of state escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned property,
and similar laws. If after reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to
effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all Eligible Customers
within 120 days after the issuance of the later of the Third-Party
Consultant’s initial report or the Third-Party Consultant’s ultimate
determination with respect to any proposed alternative recommendation,
Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of
the unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not
unacceptable to FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, or similar laws for each such
Eligible Customer.
e. Upon written request showing good cause, FINRA may extend any of the
procedural dates set forth above.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
7

Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanction in this AWC, and the
timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their own
actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:
A.

FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.
