RE:

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (Respondent) (as successor-in-interest to HefrenTillotson, Inc. (CRD No. 53))
Member Firm
CRD No. 8158

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, as successorin-interest to former member firm Hefren-Tillotson, Inc. (Respondent) submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Hefren-Tillotson became a FINRA member in 1962 and offered retail brokerage services.
On October 22, 2022, Hefren-Tillotson merged with Robert W. Baird & Co.
Incorporated, with Baird being the surviving entity and acquiring Hefren-Tillotson’s
retail brokerage business. In October 2022, Hefren-Tillotson filed a Uniform Request for
Broker-Dealer Withdrawal (Form BDW) terminating its registration, which became
effective in December 2022. At the time of its merger with Baird, Hefren-Tillotson had
175 registered representatives and six branch offices. Baird has 3,632 registered
representatives and 315 branch offices. 1
OVERVIEW
From June 30, 2020, through September 29, 2022, Hefren-Tillotson’s representatives
recommended that 432 customers open “Portfolio Review” accounts, which charged
customers commissions plus an extra fee in exchange for certain services, such as
financial planning, that these customers were already receiving in connection with other

accounts. These customers paid $557,830.64 in unnecessary fees as a result of these
recommendations. During this same period, Hefren-Tillotson failed to establish and
maintain a supervisory system, including WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with the Care Obligation of Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) with respect to
account-type recommendations. As a result, Baird, as successor-in-interest to HefrenTillotson, violated Regulation Best Interest’s Compliance Obligation and FINRA Rules
3110 and 2010. For these violations, Baird, as successor-in-interest to Hefren-Tillotson,
is fined $100,000 and has agreed to pay $557,830.64 in restitution.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from a customer complaint made to FINRA.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Reg BI under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of Reg BI
requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
securities (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best
interest of that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing
the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the
interest of the retail customer. Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange
Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(iv), requires a broker-dealer to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.
Reg BI’s Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers should consider the nature of
that firm’s operations and how to design such policies and procedures to prevent
violations from occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and to correct promptly
any violations that have occurred.2
Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires brokerdealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to,
among other things, understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with a
recommendation.
Reg BI’s Adopting Release provides that while broker-dealers may offer brokerage
accounts with varying levels of services and costs, the “choice of account type can have a
significant effect on the financial wellbeing of a retail customer.” Thus, account-type
recommendations “are subject to the Care Obligation (as well as the other components of
Regulation Best Interest.).”3
FINRA Rule 3110 requires member firms to establish, maintain, and enforce a
supervisory system, including written procedures, to supervise the activities of each
associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable
securities laws, regulations, and FINRA rules.

at 33397 (July 12, 2019).

Adopting Release at 33446.

2

Violations of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 3110 also are violations of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires associated persons to “observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade” in the conduct of their business.
Hefren-Tillotson offered its retail customers multiple account types, including brokerage
accounts and investment advisory accounts. One of the types of accounts offered by the
firm was a traditional brokerage account that enrolled customers in an advisory service
known as the Portfolio Review Program. In addition to paying commissions for securities
transactions in the traditional brokerage account, this program charged customers a fee
pursuant to an advisory agreement, assessed as a percentage of the assets under
management, in exchange for certain account-related services, including, among other
services, account aggregation, market reports and updates, financial planning, and tax
reporting services. The Portfolio Review Program services were also automatically
provided to Hefren-Tillotson customers with investment advisory accounts. The Portfolio
Review Program accounts were non-discretionary, and the firm provided no ongoing
monitoring services in connection with them.
From June 30, 2020, through September 29, 2022, Hefren-Tillotson’s registered
representatives recommended, in their brokerage capacity, that 432 retail brokerage
customers open approximately 600 Portfolio Review Program accounts, even though
those customers were already receiving Portfolio Review Program services through their
existing or simultaneously opened Portfolio Review or investment advisory accounts.
These customers did not receive any additional services by opening these Portfolio
Review accounts. As a result, these customers paid $557,830.64 in unnecessary account
fees. Baird, as successor-in-interest to Hefren-Tillotson, voluntarily discontinued
charging Portfolio Review fees and recommending Portfolio Review accounts after its
acquisition of Hefren-Tillotson’s brokerage business on October 22, 2022.
From June 30, 2020, through October 22, 2022, Hefren-Tillotson’s written procedures,
and supervisory system, were not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg
BI’s requirement that account-type recommendations are in the customer’s best interest.
The firm’s WSPs did not provide any procedures or guidance regarding the factors to
consider when recommending Portfolio Review Program accounts, including the costs
associated with such accounts and the services provided (including whether the customer
was already receiving such services). Moreover, the firm’s WSPs did not require
representatives to consider whether customers would benefit from a recommendation to
open a new Portfolio Review account when the customer was already receiving the
services provided in connection with that account type. Finally, although the firm
required principals to approve the opening of any account, the firm’s WSPs failed to
detail any steps that principals should take to determine whether an account-type
recommendation was in the customer’s best interest in light of the customer’s investment
profile, the costs of such an account, and the services provided in connection with that
account (including whether the customer was already receiving such services).

3

Therefore, Respondent violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) and FINRA Rules 3110
and 2010.
SANCTIONS CONSIDERATIONS
In determining the appropriate sanctions in this matter, FINRA considered, among other
factors: that Baird, as successor-in-interest to Hefren-Tillotson, voluntarily discontinued
charging the Portfolio Review fees and recommending Portfolio Review accounts after
its acquisition of Hefren-Tillotson’s brokerage business, and that Baird provided
substantial assistance in calculating appropriate restitution.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:


a censure;



a $100,000 fine; and



restitution of $557,830.64 plus interest as described below.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this AWC
(Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $557,830.64, plus interest at the rate set forth
in Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), from the
date of the opening of the Portfolio Review account until January 31, 2025.
A registered principal on behalf of Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment
of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each
Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect
restitution. Such proof shall be submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org
from a work-related account of the registered principal of Respondent. The email must
identify Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order,
or other method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.
The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
AWC, Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not unacceptable to

4

FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanctions in this AWC, and
the timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their
own actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Restitution payments to customers shall be followed or accompanied by a letter or other
written communication, not unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the
payment and the fact that the payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with
FINRA and as a term of this AWC.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:
A.

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B.

To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

C.

To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

D.

To appeal any such decision to the NAC and then to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.
Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.
