RE:

Highlander Capital Group, Inc. (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 19074

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Highlander Capital Group, Inc. submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Highlander Capital became a FINRA member firm in 1987. The firm, which is
headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey, has two branch offices and 17 registered
representatives. Highlander Capital’s primary business consists of equity and mutual fund
transactions for retail investors. 1
OVERVIEW
From June 30, 2020, to August 30, 2021, Highlander Capital falsely represented on the
firm’s customer relationship summary (Form CRS) that neither it nor its associated
persons had any legal or disciplinary history. In fact, both the firm and two of its
registered representatives had prior legal or disciplinary history. By filing and delivering
to customers a Form CRS with inaccurate information, Highlander Capital willfully
violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),
Exchange Act Rule 17a-14, and FINRA Rule 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from the 2021 Firm Examination for Highlander Capital.
On June 5, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Form CRS
and rules creating new requirements—which include requirements to prepare, file, and
deliver the Form CRS—for SEC-registered broker-dealers offering services to a retail
investor. The compliance date for Form CRS was June 30, 2020.
Form CRS provides customers with information about the types of services the firm
offers; the fees, costs, conflicts of interest, and required standard of conduct associated
with those services; whether the firm and its investment professionals have reportable
legal or disciplinary history; and how to get more information about the firm.
Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires registered brokerdealers to make and keep for prescribed periods such records, furnish such copies thereof,
and make and disseminate such reports as the Commission deems “necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of” the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 17a-14—titled
“Form CRS, for preparation, filing and delivery of Form CRS”—requires broker-dealers
offering services to a retail investor to prepare a Form CRS in accordance with the
instructions in Form CRS, and to comply with requirements related to filing, amending,
delivering, and posting the Form CRS to the firm’s public website.
A violation of Exchange Act § 17(a)(1) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-14 also is a violation
of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires member firms to observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their
business.
Form CRS contains the heading, “Do you or your financial professionals have legal or
disciplinary history?” The instructions to Form CRS state that a firm must respond “Yes”
if it or any of its financial professionals disclose, or are required to disclose, legal or
disciplinary history on specified regulatory disclosure forms, such as Forms BD, U4, U5,
and U6. Legal or disciplinary history that is required to be disclosed on those forms
includes criminal history, regulatory actions, civil judicial actions, and specified financial
events (e.g., bankruptcies, judgments, and liens).
Highlander Capital falsely responded “No” to the question concerning legal or
disciplinary history on its Form CRS, which it filed on June 23, 2020, prior to the
compliance date for Form CRS. In fact, the firm and two of its registered representatives
had prior legal or disciplinary history. Highlander Capital disclosed six disciplinary
actions on its Form BD. These disciplinary actions, which occurred between 1992 and
2012, included violations for late trade reporting, operating without a municipal securities
principal, operating while under net capital, and failing to retain certain email
communications. In addition, Form U4 and U6 filings for one of the firm’s registered
representatives, and Form U4, U5, and U6 filings for another registered representative,
disclosed prior legal or disciplinary history. All of those filings, and the disclosures
2

contained in the filings, were reflected in FINRA’s Central Registration Depository
(CRD) and in BrokerCheck®, and were available to the firm. Despite having disclosed
six disciplinary actions on its Form BD—and despite its knowledge of its registered
representatives’ legal or disciplinary history—Highlander Capital falsely responded “No”
to the Form CRS question concerning legal or disciplinary history. 2
Therefore, Highlander Capital willfully violated Exchange Act § 17(a)(1), Exchange Act
Rule 17a-14, and FINRA Rule 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:


a censure and



a $5,000 fine. 3

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that it willfully violated
Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-14 thereunder, and
that under Article III, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, this makes Respondent subject to
a statutory disqualification with respect to membership.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

Following FINRA staff’s investigation, Highlander Capital updated its Form CRS, effective August 30, 2021, to
respond “Yes” to the question concerning legal or disciplinary history.

2

Pursuant to the General Principles Applicable to all Sanction Determinations contained in FINRA’s Sanction

D.

To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.
Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.

directly or indirectly, any finding in this AWC or create the impression
that the AWC is without factual basis. Respondent may not take any
position in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of FINRA, or to which
FINRA is a party, that is inconsistent with any part of this AWC. Nothing
in this provision affects Respondent’s right to take legal or factual
positions in litigation or other legal proceedings in which FINRA is not a
party. Nothing in this provision affects Respondent’s testimonial
obligations in any litigation or other legal proceedings.

Respondent may attach a corrective action statement to this AWC that is a
statement of demonstrable corrective steps taken to prevent future misconduct.
Respondent understands that it may not deny the charges or make any statement
that is inconsistent with the AWC in this statement. This statement does not
constitute factual or legal findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of
FINRA.

The undersigned, on behalf of Respondent, certifies that a person duly authorized to act on
Respondent’s behalf has read and understands all of the provisions of this AWC and has been
given a full opportunity to ask questions about it; that Respondent has agreed to the AWC’s
provisions voluntarily; and that no offer, threat, inducement, or promise of any kind, other than
the terms set forth in this AWC and the prospect of avoiding the issuance of a complaint, has
been made to induce Respondent to submit this AWC.
