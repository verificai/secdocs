FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from a fom examination of Munay Securities.

A.

Murray Securities has failed to establish written policies and procedures, and
a supervisory system, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
Regulation Best Interest.

As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealer and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation Bl under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15/-1 (a)( 1) of Reg
Bl requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
securities (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best
interest of that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing
the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or a sociated person ahead of the
interest of the retail customer. Reg BI' s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange
Act Rule 15/-1 (a)(2)(iv), requires a broker-dealer to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.
Reg BI 's Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers should consider the nature of
that firm's operations and how to design such policies and procedures to prevent
violations from occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and to conect promptly
any violations that have occurred. 2
Additionally, Reg BJ's Conflict of Interest Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule
15/-l(a)(2)(iii), requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures addressing conflicts of interest, defined as interests that might
incline a broker-dealer or an associated person-consciously or unconsciously- to make
a recommendation that is not disinterested. Such procedures must be, among other things,
reasonably designed to identify and mitigate any conflicts of interest associated with
recommendations to retail customers that create an incentive for an associated person to
place the fim1's interest, or the associated person' s interest, ahead of the customer's
interest. This obligation applies to incentives that are provided to the associated person,
whether by the firm or third parties, that are within the control of or associated with the
broker-dealer's business.
FINRA Rule 3110 requires member fin11 s to establish, maintain, and enforce a
supervisory system, including written procedures. to supervise the activities of each
associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable
securities laws, regulations, and FINRA rules .
A violation of Exchange Act Rule 15/-1 (a)( 1) and FINRA Rule 3110 also is a violation of
FINRA Rule 20 I 0, which requires member firms to observe high standards of

commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their
business.
Since June 30, 2020, Murray Securities has failed to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.
The firm 's written policies and procedures contained no provisions relating to Reg Bl
until October 20, 2021. The updated policies and procedures, which remain in effect
today, discuss Reg Bl in general terms, without addressing Reg Bi's Conflict of Interest
Obligation or establishing written policies and procedures relating to conflicts of interest,
and without describing procedures for achieving compliance with Reg Bi 's Care
Obligation. 3 For example, as to the Care Obligation, the policies and procedures do not
call for registered representatives to consider costs or reasonably available alternatives
when making recommendations to retail customers. As a result, the firm failed to comply
with the Compliance Obligation and the Conflict of Interest Obligation.
Since June 30, 2020, Murray Securities also has failed to establish, maintain, and enforce
a supervisory system, including WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
Reg BI. In particular, the WSPs do not detail the supervisory steps and reviews that
should be undertaken by the principal responsible for supervising compliance with Reg
Bl-including the frequency of those reviews, how reviews should be documented, and
whether any exception reports or automated systems should be used to conduct such
reviews.
Therefore, Murray Securities willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 15/- l(a)(l) and
violated FTNRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
8.

Murray Securities has omitted required information from its Form CRS, and
has failed to establish a supervisory system, including WSPs, reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with its Form CRS obligations.

On June 5, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Form CRS
and rules creating new requirements-which include requirements to prepare, deliver,
and update the Form CRS-for SEC-registered broker-dealers offering services to a retail
investor. The compliance date for Form CRS was June 30, 2020.
Form CRS provides customers with infonnation about the types of services the firm
offers; the fees, costs, conflicts of interest, and required standard of conduct associated
with those services; whether the finn and its investment professionals have reportable
legal or disciplinary history; and how to get more information about the finn.
Form CRS also includes required "conversation starters" to help begin a discussion with
a broker-dealer about the relationship, including their services, fees, costs, conflicts, and
disciplinary information .
3

Reg BI 's Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15/-1 (a)(2)(ii), requires broker-dealers and their
associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and ski ll to, among other things, have area onablc basis to
believe that each recommended tran action or series of transactions made is in the best interest of the retail
customer.

3

Section 17(a)( l) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires registered brokerdealers to make and keep for prescribed periods such records, furnish such copies thereof,
and make and disseminate such reports as the Commission deems "necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of" the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule l 7a-14-titled
"Form CRS, for preparation, filing and delivery of Form CRS"-requires broker-dealers
offering services to a retail investor to prepare a Form CRS in accordance with the
instructions in Form CRS, and to comply with requirements related to filing, amending,
delivering, and posting the Fonn CRS to the firm's public website.
A violation of Exchange Act§ I 7(a)(l), Exchange Act Rule l 7a-14, and FfNRA Rule
31 IO also is a violation of FlNRA Rule 2010, which requires member firms to observe
high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the
conduct of their business.
Since June 30, 2020, Mu,rny Securities has omitted required information from its Fonn
CRS. For example, the film's initial Form CRS omitted required conversation sta,ters
and failed to include the required question, " Do you or your financial professionals have
legal or disciplinary history?" And while the firm included ome of this information in
the updated Fonn CRS that it filed on November 1, 2021, that Fom1 CRS continues to
omit required information. Most significantly the instructions to Form CRS require the
firm to include the following statement: " When we provide you with a recommendation,
we have to act in your best interest and not put our interest ahead of yours. At the same
time, the way we make money creates some conflicts with your interests. You should
understand and ask us about these conflicts because they can affect the recommendations
we provide you. Here are some examples to help you understand what this means."
Murray Securities' Form CRS, however, does not include the entire statement or provide
examples of potential conflicts of interest.
Since June 30, 2020, Murray Securities also has failed to establish and maintain a
supervisory system, including WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with its
Form CRS obligations. Until October 20, 2021, Murray Securities' WSPs contained no
reference to Form CRS. Although the firm's updated WSPs, which remain in effect
today, address Fom1 CRS, they do not prescribe procedures for supervising how the firm
shou ld review its Form CRS to determine whether updates are required, or how the firm
should maintain records regarding its delivery of Fonn CRS to each retail investor.
Accordingly, Munay Securities willfully violated Exchange Act § I 7(a)( I) and Exchange
Act Rule 17a-14, and violated FTNRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

•

a censure;

•

a $35,000 fine; and

4

AWC, a member of Respondent's management who is a registered principal of
the firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification, the firm

delivered, and posted to its publicly-available website a Form CRS that complies
with Exchange Act§ l 7(a)( 1), Exchange Act Rule 17a-14, and FINRA Rule
2010; and (b) implemented a supervisory system (inc luding WSPs) and training
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with both Regulation Best Interest and
with Fonn CRS requirements. The ce1tification shall include a narrative
description and suppo11ing exhibits sufficient to demonstrate Respondent's
remediation and implementation. FlNRA staff may request further evidence of
Respondent's remediation and implementation, and Respondent agrees to provide
such evidence. Respondent shall submit the certification to Rebecca Segrest,
Senior Counsel, FINRA, Department of Enforcement, 9509 Key West Avenue,
Rockville, MD 20850-3329, with a copy to Rcbecca.Segrcst@finra.org and
EnforcementNotice(a)finra.org. Upon written request showing good cause,
FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that it willfully violated
Section l 7(a)( l) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 15!1(a)(l) and 17a-14, and that under Article III, Section 4 ofFJNRA's By-Laws, this makes
