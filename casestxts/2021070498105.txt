RE:

Matthew I. Turner (Respondent)
General Securities Representative
CRD No. 4114088

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Matthew I. Turner submits this Letter of Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consent (A WC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule
violations described below. This A WC is submitted on the condition that, if accepted, FINRA
will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based on the same
factual findings described in this A WC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND
Turner first became registered with FINRA as a General Securities Representative (GS)
in 2000 through an association with a FINRA member firm. Since November 2012,
Turner has been registered as a GS through WestPark Capital, Inc. (CRD No. 39914), and
accordingly he is subject to FINRA' s jurisdiction. 1

OVERVIEW
Between September 2018 and December 2020, Turner recommended trading in accounts
held by three customers that was excessive, unsuitable, and not in their best interest. By
this conduct, Turner willfully violated Rule I 5!-1 (a)(I) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Reg Bl) (for conduct on and after June 30, 2020), violated FINRA Rule
2111 (for conduct prior to June 30, 2020), and violated FINRA Rule 2010.
During the same period, Turner exercised discretionary authority to effect 148 trades in
four customers' accounts without obtaining written authorization from the customers to

exercise discretion and without his firm having accepted the accounts as discretionary, in
violation of NASD Rule 251 0(b) and FINRA Rules 3260(b) and 20 I 0. 2

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
Excessive Trading
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation BI under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 151-l(a)(l) of Reg
BI requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
securities (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best
interest of that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing
the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the
interest of the retail customer. Reg Bi's Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule
15/-1 (a)(2)(ii), requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable
diligence, care, and skill to, among other things, have a reasonable basis to believe that a
series ofrecommended transactions, even if in the retail customer's best interest when
viewed in isolation, is not excessive and is in the retail customer's best interest in light of
the retail customer's investment profile.
No single test defines when trading is excessive, but factors such as the turnover rate, the
cost-to-equity ratio, and the use of in-and-out trading in a customer's account are relevant
to determining whether a member firm or associated person has excessively traded a
customer's account in violation of Reg Bl. The turnover rate represents the number of
times that a portfolio of securities is exchanged for another portfolio of securities. The
cost-to-equity ratio measures the amount an account must appreciate just to cover
commissions and other expenses. In other words, it is the break-even point where a
customer may begin to see a return. A turnover rate of six or more, or a cost-to-equity
ratio above 20 percent, generally indicates that a series ofrecommended transactions was
excessive.
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 required members and associated persons to
have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation of a transaction or investment
strategy involving a security or securities to any customer is suitable for the customer.
Under Rule 211 l.0S(c), members and associated persons with actual or de facto control
over an account were required to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of
recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, is not excessive
and unsuitable for the customer in light of the customer's investment profile. FINRA Rule
2111 is still in effect, but as of June 30, 2020, it no longer applies to recommendations
that are subject to Reg BI, and the element of control was removed from the quantitative
suitability component.

~ FJNRA Rule 3260 superseded NASD Rule 2510 on May 8, 2019. Therefore, Turner violated NASD Rule 251 0(b)

for conduct before May 8, 2019, and FINRA Rule 3260(b) for conduct occurring on or after May 8, 2019.

2

A violation of Reg BI or FINRA Rule 2111 also is a violation ofFINRA Rule 2010,
which requires associated persons to "observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade" in the conduct of their business.
In August 2018, Customer Al (who was then 71 years old) and Customer A2 (who was
then 63 years old) opened a joint account with Turner at WestPark. At all relevant times,
Customers A I and A2 relied on Turner's advice and routinely followed his
recommendations and, as a result, Turner exercised de facto control over the customers'
account. Between September 2018 and March 2020, Turner placed 72 trades in the joint
account. During this period, the trading in the joint account generated $9,613.76 in
commissions and resulted in realized losses of $115,183, an annualized turnover rate of
13.01, and an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 50.49%. The high cost-to-equity ratio
meant the account would have to grow by more than 50% annually just to break even.
This level of trading was excessive and unsuitable.
In August 2018, Customer B opened an account with WestPark. Turner became the
broker of record for the account in September 2019. At all relevant times, Customer B
relied on Turner's advice and routinely followed his recommendations and, as a result,
Turner exercised de facto control over the customer's account. Between October 2019
and December 2020, Turner placed 110 trades in Customer B's account. During this
period, the trading in the account generated $24,655.93 in commissions and resulted in
realized losses of$45,639, an annualized turnover rate of 9.04, and an annualized cost-toequity ratio of27.58%. The high cost-to-equity ratio meant the customer's account would
have to grow by more than 27% annually just to break even. This level of trading was
excessive, unsuitable, and not in the customer's best interest.
Therefore, Turner willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 15/-1 (a)(l) and violated FINRA
Rules 2111 and 2010.

Unauthorized Use ofDiscretion
NASD Rule 251 0(b) and FINRA Rule 3260(b) prohibit a registered representative from
exercising discretionary power in a customer's account unless (1) the customer has given
prior written authorization and (2) the representative's member firm has accepted the
account as discretionary, as evidenced in writing by the member.
A violation ofNASD Rule 251 0(b) or FINRA Rule 3260(b) is also a violation ofFINRA
Rule 2010.
During the relevant period, Turner exercised discretionary authority when placing 148
trades in four customers' accounts, including the three customers' accounts he
excessively traded. Although the customers understood that Turner was conducting
trading in their accounts, the customers had not provided prior written authorization for
Turner to exercise discretion. In addition, WestPark did not accept the accounts as
discretionary.

Through this conduct, Turner violated NASD Rule 2510(b) and FINRA Rules 3260(b)
and 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
•

a five-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all
capacities and

•

restitution of $27,415.75 plus interest as described below.

Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this A WC
(Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $27,415.75, plus interest at the rate set forth
in Section 662l(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), from
December 31, 2020, until the date this AWC is accepted by the National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC).
Respondent has submitted a statement of financial condition and demonstrated an
inability to pay full restitution immediately upon issuance of the A WC. In light of the
financial status of Respondent, restitution to the Eligible Customers shall be payable on
the schedule and in the amounts listed on Attachment A, commencing with the first
payment to be made on the 15th day of the month following the notice of acceptance of
theAWC.
Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment ofrestitution and interest
(separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each Eligible Customer) or of
reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution after each payment
due under the installment plan. Such proof shall be submitted by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org. The email must identify Respondent and the case
number and include a copy of the check, money order, or other method of payment. This
proof shall be provided by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 15
days after each payment is due.
The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer's property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts unde1taken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within I 5 days after each payment is due, Respondent shall submit to
FINRA in the manner described above a list of the unpaid Eligible Customers and a
description of Respondent's plan, not unacceptable to FINRA, to comply with the
applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned prope1ty, or similar laws for
each such Eligible Customer.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this A WC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.

4

The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanction in this A WC, and the
timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their own
actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
As stated, Respondent has submitted a statement of financial condition and demonstrated
a limited ability to pay. In light of Respondent's financial status, the sanctions do not
include a monetary fine.
Respondent understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member, he becomes subject to a statutory disqualification as that term is defined
in Article III, Section 4 ofFINRA's By-Laws, incorporating Section 3(a)(39) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, he may not be associated with any
FINRA member in any capacity, including clerical or ministerial functions, during the
period of the bar or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that he willfully violated
Rule 15/-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that under Article III, Section 4 of
FINRA's By-Laws, this makes him subject to a statutory disqualification with respect to
association with a member.
The sanctions imposed in this A WC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

II.
