RE:

Securities Research, Inc. of Florida (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 6516

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Securities Research, Inc. of Florida submits this
Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of
the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Securities Research, Inc. of Florida has been a FINRA member firm since 1979.
Headquartered in Vero Beach, Florida, the firm has two branch offices and 15 registered
representatives. The firm conducts a general securities business with retail customers. 1
OVERVIEW
Since at least July 2018, Securities Research has failed to establish, maintain, and enforce
a supervisory system, including written procedures, reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with the suitability requirements of FINRA Rule 2111 and the Care
Obligation of Rule 15l-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Regulation Best
Interest or Reg BI), as they pertain to short-term switches of Class A mutual funds.
Moreover, from July 2018 to November 2021, the firm failed to reasonably supervise
short-term switches of Class A mutual funds by one of its registered representatives in the
accounts of two customers, who collectively paid $43,724.87 in excess sales charges.
Therefore, Securities Research has violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. In addition,

since June 30, 2020, the firm has violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) by failing to
comply with the Compliance Obligation of Reg BI.
Since at least July 2018, Securities Research also has failed to establish, maintain, and
enforce a system, including written procedures, reasonably designed to supervise the
application of: (1) sales charge waivers to which customers are entitled through exchange
privileges offered by mutual fund companies; and (2) sales charge waivers and fee
rebates to which customers are entitled through rights of reinstatement offered by mutual
fund companies. Between July 2018 and June 2021, eleven customers paid $51,600.42 in
excess sales charges and fees. Therefore, Securities Research violated FINRA Rules 3110
and 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from a FINRA firm examination of Securities Research.
FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation BI under the Securities Exchange Act. Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of Reg BI
requires a broker, dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
securities (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best
interest of that retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing
the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the
interest of the retail customer. Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange
Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(iv), requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.
Reg BI’s Adopting Release provides that broker-dealers should consider the nature of
that firm’s operations and how to design such policies and procedures to prevent
violations from occurring, detect violations that have occurred, and to correct promptly
any violations that have occurred.
A violation of FINRA Rule 3110 or Reg BI also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires firms to “observe high standards of commercial honor and just and
equitable principles of trade” in the conduct of their business.
Reg BI’s Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires brokerdealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to,
among other things, have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation is in the
2

best interest of a particular retail customer based on that retail customer’s investment
profile and the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with the recommendation.
Reg BI’s Adopting Release provides that consideration of reasonably available
alternatives offered by the broker-dealer is an inherent aspect of making a “best interest”
recommendation.
Prior to June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 required members and associated persons to
have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation of a transaction or investment
strategy involving a security or securities to any customer is suitable for the customer,
based on the information obtained through the reasonable diligence of the member or
associated person to ascertain the customer’s investment profile. FINRA Rule 2111
defines a customer’s investment profile to include the same information as under the Care
Obligation. Under Rule 2111, broker-dealers were required to consider costs associated
with a recommendation as part of their reasonable diligence. FINRA Rule 2111 is still in
effect, but as of June 30, 2020, it no longer applies to recommendations that are subject to
Reg BI.
A. Securities Research has failed to establish and maintain a system reasonably
designed to supervise short-term mutual fund switching, and the firm failed to
supervise switches effected by one registered representative in two customer
accounts.
Mutual funds are comprised of several classes of shares. Class A mutual fund shares
typically include substantial upfront sales charges, known as “front-end loads.” They are
generally suitable, or in the customer’s best interest, only as long-term investments and
not for short-term trading, because an investor usually must hold the Class A share for a
long period of time to recoup the front-end load. Frequent short-term purchases and sales
of Class A shares in a customer’s account may be unsuitable, or not in the customer’s
best interest, because of the frequency of the transactions, the transaction costs incurred,
or the customer’s financial situation, investment objectives, and needs. Mutual fund
switching occurs when a customer sells mutual fund shares and reinvests the proceeds in
another mutual fund, often incurring additional charges and commissions.
Since at least July 2018, Securities Research’s written procedures, and supervisory
system, have not been reasonably designed to address short-term switches of Class A
mutual funds. Acknowledging that mutual funds are “conservative long-term
investments,” and that the sales fees associated with them “almost prohibits the investor
from profitable ‘trading,’” the firm’s written procedures have required supervisors to
review short-term mutual fund switches on a monthly basis to “prevent and detect excess
switching and charges.” But the firm’s procedures have failed to describe the steps that
supervisors must take when conducting these monthly reviews, and the firm has failed to
establish a system reasonably designed to determine whether short-term mutual fund
switches were suitable and in the customer’s best interest. The firm has not used tools
offered by its clearing firm or any reasonable alternative designed to achieve compliance
with Rule 2111 and Reg BI in connection with short-term switches. Instead, the firm has
3

relied on its supervisors’ manual review of a monthly report of mutual fund transactions.
This report, however, has omitted the information necessary to identify whether a
transaction constitutes a short-term sale, such as the date that the mutual fund was
purchased. And although the firm’s supervisors sometimes manually researched this
information, they did not do so consistently, and Securities Research’s written
supervisory procedures did not require that they do so.
Additionally, since June 2020, Securities Research’s written policies and procedures have
required registered representatives to consider reasonably available alternatives when
making recommendations to retail customers. However, these policies and procedures
have not detailed the steps that representatives must take to comply with this requirement
when recommending mutual fund switches, such as consideration of whether a
comparable mutual fund within the same fund family as the customer’s existing position
is available at a lower cost. Nor have the firm’s written supervisory procedures described
what supervisors must do to review representatives’ consideration of reasonably available
alternatives.
As a result of these supervisory deficiencies, Securities Research failed to take reasonable
steps to review one of its registered representatives’ recommendations of short-term
switches of Class A mutual funds. Between July 2018 and September 2021, the registered
representative recommended and effected 25 short-term switches that were unsuitable for
or not in the best interest of two senior customers. 2 All of these switches were part of a
pattern of switching between different mutual fund families. And while not part of any
switch, in November 2021, at the representative’s recommendation, one of the two senior
customers also sold Class A mutual fund shares that she had held for only a month. The
firm manually flagged some of the short-term switches that the representative effected in
these customers’ accounts, but it largely confined its supervisory review to confirming
that the customers had approved them. Securities Research did not assess whether the
representative exercised reasonable diligence in recommending the transactions, either
before or after the transactions took place. Further, for those transactions effected on or
after June 30, 2020, Securities Research did not review whether the representative
exercised reasonable diligence, care, and skill to consider reasonably available
alternatives, including mutual fund share classes in the same fund family as the
customers’ existing holdings, or different mutual fund share classes, that may have
achieved the customers’ objectives at a lower cost. The firm failed to assess whether the
transactions were suitable for or in the best interest of the two customers, who
collectively paid $43,724.87 in excessive sales charges.
Therefore, Securities Research has violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010 (since at least
July 2018), and also has violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) (since June 30, 2020).

22 of these switches were effected between July 2018 and June 29, 2020, and three of the switches were effected
on or after June 30, 2020.

B. Securities Research has failed to reasonably supervise mutual fund exchange
privileges and rights of reinstatement to which customers are entitled.
Mutual fund issuers generally offer various privileges to their shareholders, which are
identified in a fund’s prospectus or statement of additional information. These privileges
may include exchange privileges or rights of reinstatement. An exchange privilege may
be available where an investor sells shares of a fund and, on the same day, purchases
shares of that fund or another fund in the same fund family. In the event of these sameday exchanges, mutual fund companies may waive front-end sales charges on investors’
reinvestments and contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC) on investors’ sales. For
exchanges within the same fund family in which the sale and reinvestment occur on
different days, mutual fund companies may offer rights of reinstatement. To be eligible
for a right-of-reinstatement benefit, the period between the sale and the repurchase must
fall within a designated time frame—typically ranging between 30 and 120 days but, in
some cases, up to two years, depending on the fund family. A right of reinstatement
entitles an investor to a waiver of the front-end sales charge on the reinvestment, or to a
fee rebate through which the investor recoups all or part of a CDSC (typically, but not
always, involving Class A shares).
Since at least July 2018, Securities Research’s system, including written procedures, has
not been reasonably designed to supervise the firm’s application of mutual fund exchange
privileges and rights-of-reinstatement benefits. While the firm’s written supervisory
procedures required supervisors to conduct daily reviews of sales charges on mutual fund
transactions, the procedures did not describe the steps that principals must take to identify
appropriate sales discounts or waivers. The firm did not equip its supervisors with the
information necessary to detect excessive sales fees during their manual reviews of
mutual fund transactions, such as information about whether the mutual fund company
offered an exchange privilege for same-day exchanges. Nor did the firm have an
automated surveillance system to flag instances in which customers were entitled to
exchange privileges. Instead, Securities Research incorrectly believed, without verifying,
that its clearing firm prohibited transactions for which customers would incur sales
charges on same-day exchanges within a fund family, or, at minimum, that the clearing
firm flagged such exchanges. Additionally, Securities Research did not have any
system—whether manual or automated—to evaluate instances in which customers were
potentially eligible for rights-of-reinstatement benefits.
From July 2018 to June 2021, Securities Research failed to provide 11 customer accounts
with the mutual fund exchange privileges or rights-of-reinstatement benefits to which
they were entitled. As a result, those customers paid $51,600.42 in excess sales charges
and fees relating to 39 mutual fund exchanges.
Therefore, Securities Research has violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:


a censure;
5



a $60,000 fine;



restitution of $49,253.72 plus interest as described below;3 and



an undertaking that, within 60 days of the date of the notice of acceptance of this
AWC, a member of Respondent’s senior management who is a registered
principal of the firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification,
the firm has remediated the issues identified in this AWC and implemented
written policies and procedures, and a supervisory system, including WSPs,
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Regulation Best Interest
regarding the issues identified in this AWC. The certification shall include a
narrative description and supporting exhibits sufficient to demonstrate
Respondent’s remediation and implementation. FINRA staff may request further
evidence of Respondent’s remediation and implementation, and Respondent
agrees to provide such evidence. Respondent shall submit the certification to
Jamie P. Keesing, Counsel, 9509 Key West Avenue, Rockville, MD 20850, and
Jamie.Keesing@finra.org, with a copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. Upon
written request showing good cause, FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this AWC
(Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $49,253.72, plus interest at the rate set forth
in Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), from the
date of each transaction until the date this AWC is accepted by the National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC).
A registered principal on behalf of Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment
of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each
Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect
restitution. Such proof shall be submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org
from a work-related account of the registered principal of Respondent. The email must
identify Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order,
or other method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.
In February 2024, prior to the effective date of this AWC, Securities Research provided proof to FINRA staff that
it had paid full restitution, plus interest, to seven customers, and partial restitution, plus interest, to four customers.
Attachment A sets forth key details for each of the transactions at issue for each of the 11 customers, including
whether the restitution is attributable to a short-term switch, a lost privilege (exchange privilege or right of
reinstatement), or both, and the extent to which restitution has been paid in connection with each transaction and
customer. The restitution order reflects excess sales charges and fees incurred by the four customers to whom
Securities Research has not yet paid full restitution.

3

6

The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
AWC, Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not unacceptable to
FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.
The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanctions in this AWC, and
the timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their
own actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.
Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that it failed to supervise
an individual who violated Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
that under Article III, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, this makes it subject to a statutory
disqualification with respect to membership.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:
A.

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B.

To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

C.

To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

7

D.

To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.
Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.
III.

Respondent understands that:
A.

Submission of this AWC is voluntary and will not resolve this matter unless and
until it has been reviewed and accepted by the NAC, a Review Subcommittee of
the NAC, or the Office of Disciplinary Affairs (ODA), pursuant to FINRA Rule
9216;

B.

If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as evidence to prove
any of the allegations against Respondent; and

C.

program in accordance with FINRA Rule 8313;

3.

directly or indirectly, any finding in this AWC or create the impression
that the AWC is without factual basis. Respondent may not take any
position in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of FINRA, or to which
FINRA is a party, that is inconsistent with any part of this AWC. Nothing
8

in this provision affects Respondent’s right to take legal or factual
positions in litigation or other legal proceedings in which FINRA is not a
party. Nothing in this provision affects Respondent’s testimonial
obligations in any litigation or other legal proceedings.
D.

Respondent may attach a corrective action statement to this AWC that is a
statement of demonstrable corrective steps taken to prevent future misconduct.
Respondent understands that it may not deny the charges or make any statement
that is inconsistent with the AWC in this statement. This statement does not
constitute factual or legal findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of
FINRA.

The undersigned, on behalf of Respondent, certifies that a person duly authorized to act on
Respondent’s behalf has read and understands all of the provisions of this AWC and has been
given a full opportunity to ask questions about it; that Respondent has agreed to the AWC’s
provisions voluntarily; and that no offer, threat, inducement, or promise of any kind, other than
the terms set forth in this AWC and the prospect of avoiding the issuance of a complaint, has
