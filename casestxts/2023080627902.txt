RE:

Richard Mireles (Respondent)
General Securities Principal
CRD No. 5288651

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Richard Mireles submits this Letter of Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule
violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if accepted, FINRA
will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based on the same
factual findings described in this AWC.
I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:
BACKGROUND
Mireles first registered with FINRA in 2007. In May 2010, Mireles registered as a
General Securities Representative through an association with Independent Financial
Group, LLC (CRD No. 7717) (IFG). He also has been registered with FINRA as a
General Securities Principal through IFG since November 2010. Since May 2018,
President of Supervision.1
OVERVIEW
Between July 2020 and December 2022, Mireles failed to reasonably respond to red
flags, which were escalated to him, of excessive trading by a registered representative
counts, and therefore failed to reasonably
supervise, in violation of FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
A. Applicable rules.
FINRA Rule 3110 requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce a system,
including written supervisory procedures, to supervise the activities of each associated
person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws

and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. The duty to supervise under Rule 3110
also includes the responsibility for firms and their designated supervisors to reasonably
investigate red flags of potential misconduct and to act upon the results of their
investigation.
FINRA Rule 2010 requires associated persons, in the conduct of their business, to
observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles on trade. A
violation of FINRA Rule 3110 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Regulation BI under the Securities
Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii), requires broker-dealers and
their associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to, among other
things, have a reasonable basis to believe that a series of recommended transactions is not
Under FINRA Rule 2111(a)2 members and associated persons are required to have a
reasonable basis for believing that a series of recommended transactions are not
excessive.

him, of excessive trading by a registered representative who excessively

team, of an IFG registered representative w

July 2020 and December 2022, numerous trades placed by the registered representative in
ared on that alert, which was based on a
ruleset whose parameters were designed to flag solicited trades with a high principal
amount.
Mireles failed to reasonably respond when these indicia of excessive trading were
brought to his attention. The lower-level designated supervisors reviewing trade alerts
developed concerns that the registered repr
accounts and brought these concerns to Mirele
an IFG supervisor alerted Mireles to his concerns about the volume of high-principal
solicited trades that the registered representative was placing in
including the accounts of senior customers. This was the second supervisor to raise such
concerns to Mireles. Mireles, however, directed the supervisor to perform only trade-bytrade assessments to review for compliance with Reg BI and suitability, and not to review
the series of trades that the registered representative was placing within an account for
potential excessive trading.

As of June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 continues to apply to non-retail customers who are not subject to Reg BI.

Between July 2020 and December 2022, the registered representative excessively traded
investment profiles and that was not in their best interest or was not suitable. 3
Collectively, these five customers paid more than $2.2 million in total trading costs and
incurred realized losses totaling approximately $2.2 million. For example, one customer
was, in July 2020, a 77-year-old retiree with a capital preservation investment objective
and a moderate risk tolerance. The regist
annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 20.3%. This customer paid more than $490,000 in total
trading costs and incurred realized losses of more than $550,000, inclusive of
commissions. Another account was in the name of a trust owned by a retiree who was 88years old when she died in 2022. The trust account had an investment objective of growth
and income and a moderate risk tolerance.
produced an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 23.4%. This account paid more than
$650,000 in total trading costs and incurred realized losses of more than $560,000,
inclusive of commissions.
Therefore, from July 2020 through December 2022, Mireles violated FINRA Rules 3110
and 2010.
B.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
a four-month suspension from association with any FINRA member in all
principal capacities; and
a $5,000 fine.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which he proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.
Respondent understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member in any principal capacity, he becomes subject to a statutory
disqualification as that term is defined in
incorporating Section 3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly,
Respondent may not be associated with any FINRA member in any principal capacity,
during the period of the bar or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311.
Furthermore, because Respondent is subject to a statutory disqualification during the

suspension, if he remains associated with a member firm in a non-suspended capacity, an

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
