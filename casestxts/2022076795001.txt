ACCEPTA
A.

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND
In October 2000, Snyder first became registered with FINRA as a General Securities
Representative (GSR) through an association with Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC
(CRD 6363). In a Unifonn Termination Notice of Securities Industry Registration (Form
U5) dated November 3, 2022, Ameriprise reported Snyder's termination for "[v]iolation
of[thc] finn's ETF solicitation policy."
Although Snyder is not currently registered or associated with a FTNRA member, he
remains subject to FIN RA ·s jurisdiction, pursuant to Article V, Section 4(a) of
FINRA 's By-Laws. 1
OVERVJEW

Between January 2022 and August 2022, Snyder recommended that 18 retail customers
make 33 purchases of securities without having a sufficient understanding of the risks
and features associated with the products he recommended, and without analyzing
whether the recommendations were in the best interest of any individual customer. As a

FACT A D VIOLATIVE CO r>UCT

This matter originated from FINRA 's 1evicw of1he Ameriprise Fonn U5 filing.
Reg11lation Best /,iterest

A~ of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons arc required to comply
With Regulation Bl under the Securities Exchange Acl of 1934. Rule 15/-l(a)( I) of Reg
BJ requires a broker. dealer, or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when
making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving
~ecurilies (including account recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best
rnlerest of that retail customer al the time the recommendation is made, without placing
the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the
interest of the retail customer. Reg Br's Care Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule
15/-1 (a)(2)(ii). requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to exercise reasonable
diligence, care, and skill to, among other things, understand the potential risks, rewards,
and eosts associated with a recommendation. Reg BI's Adopting Release provides that
what constitutes ''reasonable diligence" depends on, among other things, the complexity
of. and risks associated with, the recommended security. 2 The Care Obligation requires
broker-dealers and their associated persons to have a reasonable basis to believe that the
recommendation could be in the bes! interest of al least some retail investors.
Reg Bi's Care Obligation also requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to
exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to, among other things, have a reasonable
basis to believe that the recommendation is in the best interest of a particular retail
customer based on that retail customer's investment profile and the potential risks,
rewards, and costs associated with the recommendation. Regulation Bl defines a "retail
customer investment profile" to include, but not be limited to, the customer's age, other
investments, financial situation and needs. tax status, investment objectives, investment
experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other

recommendation lo the customer's investment profile. an assocrntcd pl'r on c;hould also
excrr,se rea:-on:iblc dihgenee, care. and skill to conc;1der reasonably avmlahlc
alternatives. 4
A violatton of Reg Bl also is a v1olat1on of FINRA Ruic 20 I0, which requires associated
persons to "observe high standards of commercial honor and Just and equitable prsnciples
of trade" in the conduct of their business.
Snyder recommended purchases that were not;,, the best interest of his customers.

Between January 2022 and August 2022. Snyder ;ccommcndcd that 13 retail customers
invest m leveraged exchange-traded funds, also known as Non-Traditional ExchangeTraded Products (NT-ETPs) on 18 occasions. These products seek to return multiples of
the perfonnance of an undcrlymg index or benchmark they track. Most NT-ETPs reset
daily, meaning they are designed to achieve their stated objectives over the course of one
trading session, i.e., a single day. As explained in FINRA Regulatory Notice 09-31, the
performance ofNT-ETPs over periods of time longer than a single trading session can
differ significantly from the pcrfonnance of their underlying index or benchmark during
the same period of time. This Notice also advises that NT-ETFs ..typically arc not
suitable for retail investors who plan to hold them for more than one trading session,
particularly in volatile markets." In addition, on I 5 occasions, Snyder recommended that
11 customers, including six of the 1J customers discussed above, invest in equity
securities of two companies engaged in crypto asset mining.
Snyder did not have a reasonable basis to believe that the investments he recommended
were suitable for any retail customer. Snyder did not have an understanding of the
features and risks associated with the investments, including the holding-period risk of
NT-ETPs or the volatility of the recommended stocks, and he was unfamiliar with the
strategies or relative costs of the products he recommended. Snyder did not conduct
research about the NT-ETPs he recommended and did not review their prospectuses,
which specifically stated "[i)f you are considering holding fund shares for longer than a
day, it's important that you understand the impact of Index returns and Index volatility
(how much the value of the Index moves up and down from day-to-day) on your holding

total realized losses of approximately $30.000 Snyder received total comrn1ss1ons or
SJ.699.03 m conncc11on with all 33 ofhi:. customers' purchases.

Therefore. Snyder willfully violated Exchange Act Ruic 15/-1 (a)( I) and violated FINRA
Rule 2010.

Sny,ft,r caused Ameriprise to make and preserve i11"ccurate hooks a11d records.
FINRA Rule 4511 requires FINl{A members to make and preserve books and records in
confonnity with Exchange Act Sec11on J7(a) and Rule I7a-3 thereunder. Exchange Act
Rule 17a-3 requires member finns, among other things, to make and keep a record of
"each brokerage order" showing "the tenns and conditions of the order." including
"whether the order was solicited or unsolicited." Inherent in the obligation to make and
preserve books and records is the requirement that they be accurate. A registered
representative who causes their finn to fail to comply with these record-keeping
obligations violates FINRA Ruic 4511. A violation orFINRA Rule 4511 is also a
violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
Between January and August 2022, Snyder rnismarked 32 order tickets associated with
the recommendations described above as unsolicited when he had solicited the trades. By
mismarking these order tickets, Snyder caused Ameriprise to make and preserve
inaccurate books and records with respect to these trades in violation of Section I 7{a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule I 7a-3 thereunder.
Therefore. Snyder violated FfNRA Rules 4511 and 20 I 0.

Snyder exercised discretion wit/tout 111ritte11 autftorizatio11.
FIN RA Rule 3260(b) prohibits a registered representative from exercising discretionary
trading authority in a customer's account unless the customer has given the representative
prior written authorization and the account has been accepted in writing as a discretionary

S Ameriprise offered rescission of 1he relevant transactions to each of the cus1omers.
