Based on section (2)(ii) of ยง 240.15l-1 Regulation Best Interest (the "Care obligation"), the following violations occurred:

1. **Mismatch between investment purpose and recommended investments**: The customer's stated investment purpose is "Anticipated upcoming expenses (home down payment or child's college tuition)" which suggests a short-term need for liquidity. However, 70% of the portfolio is allocated to high-risk investments (Technology Sector ETF, Growth Stock Fund, Cryptocurrency ETF). These high-risk investments are inappropriate for short-term goals as they have high volatility and could result in significant losses when the funds are needed.

2. **Unsuitable risk level for financial situation**: The customer has a low income ($45K/year), low net worth ($75K), high mortgage ($180K), and personal loans, yet 70% of their small portfolio ($15K total) is in high-risk investments. This excessive risk allocation fails to consider the customer's financial vulnerability and limited capacity to absorb losses.

3. **Excessive transactions**: The broker recommended six separate transactions within six months for a small portfolio of $15K, which could generate unnecessary transaction costs that deplete the customer's limited resources.

4. **Inappropriate allocation for education funding**: The customer's stated financial goal is "Education Funding," but the investment selections and high-risk profile contradict prudent education funding strategies, which typically require more stable, preservation-focused investments, especially given the anticipated upcoming expenses.

These recommendations violate the Care obligation because the broker failed to have "a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation is in the best interest of a particular retail customer based on that retail customer's investment profile and the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with the recommendation."
