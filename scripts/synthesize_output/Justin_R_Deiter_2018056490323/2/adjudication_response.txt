# Violations of Section (2)(ii) Care Obligation

Based on the provided customer profile, allocation strategy, and transaction history, there are several violations of the Care Obligation under ยง 240.15l-1(a)(2)(ii):

1. **Inconsistency between risk profile and investments (violation of 2(ii)(B)):**
   - The customer has a "Moderate" risk tolerance, but was recommended high-risk investments like "Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)" and "Technology Sector ETF" without proper justification based on their investment profile. These recommendations do not appear to have a reasonable basis to believe they are in the customer's best interest given their stated moderate risk tolerance.

2. **Excessive transactions in relation to financial goals (violation of 2(ii)(C)):**
   - The customer's primary financial goal is "Retirement," but several transactions (e.g., the REIT and Technology ETF investments) were recommended for purposes like "Income" and "Growth" without clear connection to the customer's stated retirement objective. The broker failed to ensure that this series of transactions, when taken together, aligns with the customer's primary investment profile and goals.

3. **Potential overallocation to higher risk investments (violation of 2(ii)(B)):**
   - When examined collectively, the transactions represent a potential overallocation to higher risk investments compared to what would be suitable for a moderate risk investor focused on retirement. The high-risk investments constitute a significant portion of the investment activity, which may not be in the best interest of this particular retail customer.

4. **Frequency of transactions (violation of 2(ii)(C)):**
   - The frequency of transactions (10 transactions in approximately 13 months) may be excessive given the customer's investment profile and retirement focus, potentially generating unnecessary transaction costs without sufficient benefit to the customer.

These violations suggest that the broker did not exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill in making recommendations that align with the customer's investment profile, particularly regarding risk tolerance and financial goals, as required by the Care Obligation under Regulation Best Interest.
