The violations under section 2(ii), the Care Obligation, are:

1. Violation of section (2)(ii)(B): The broker failed to have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendations were in the best interest of this 89-year-old retired customer based on their investment profile:

   - Despite the customer's advanced age (89), the broker recommended highly speculative, high-risk investments (75% of portfolio in moderate-to-very high risk investments) including Cryptocurrency ETF (15%), Private Equity Fund (10%), and Hedge Fund (10%).
   
   - This allocation is unsuitable for an elderly retired individual with low income ($45K/year), even with their stated "Aggressive" risk tolerance. The broker should have questioned whether this risk tolerance was appropriate given the customer's age and income situation.

2. Violation of section (2)(ii)(C): The series of transactions was excessive and not in the customer's best interest when taken together:

   - The transactions show multiple high-risk investments purchased in quick succession over less than a year, representing a substantial portion of the customer's net worth.
   
   - The total investment amount across transactions ($350,000) represents approximately 54% of the customer's total net worth ($650,000), with most allocated to high-risk investments.
   
   - The pattern of transactions suggests excessive trading that prioritizes speculative investments inappropriate for an 89-year-old retiree who should typically be focused on capital preservation and income generation rather than aggressive speculation.

These recommendations appear to place the broker's financial interests ahead of the customer's interests, as high-risk products typically generate higher commissions and fees for brokers, violating the fundamental requirement of Regulation Best Interest.
