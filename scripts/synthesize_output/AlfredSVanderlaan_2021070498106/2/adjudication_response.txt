# Violations of Section (2)(ii) Care Obligation

Based on the provided information, there are several potential violations of the care obligation under Section 240.15l-1(a)(2)(ii):

## 1. High-Risk Investments for Moderate Risk Tolerance Customer

The customer's profile clearly indicates a "Moderate" risk tolerance. However, the transactions from November 18, 2023 (REIT) and December 5, 2023 (Technology Sector ETF) involve investments categorized as "High" risk. This appears to violate Section (2)(ii)(B) because:

- The broker failed to have a reasonable basis to believe these high-risk recommendations were in the best interest of this particular customer given their moderate risk profile
- The recommendations do not align with the customer's investment profile
- These investments may place the broker's interests (potentially higher commissions from riskier products) ahead of the customer's interest in maintaining a moderate risk portfolio

## 2. Excessive Trading Concern

The transaction history shows 8 separate investment purchases within a single year (2023) totaling $210,000, which represents approximately 47% of the customer's stated investment portfolio value of $450,000. This high turnover and concentrated activity period may constitute excessive trading under Section (2)(ii)(C) because:

- The series of transactions, even if potentially suitable individually, may not be in the customer's best interest when taken together
- The frequency and size of transactions could suggest churning to generate commissions
- There's insufficient evidence that this level of trading activity aligns with the customer's primary financial goal of "Retirement"

## 3. Misalignment with Stated Financial Goals

The customer's primary financial goal is "Retirement," but several transactions (particularly those labeled for "Wealth Growth" and "Income Generation") may not be properly aligned with this long-term objective. This potentially violates Section (2)(ii)(B) as the broker may not have a reasonable basis to believe all recommendations match the customer's stated investment profile and objectives.

These violations suggest the broker may have failed to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill in making recommendations that truly align with the customer's risk tolerance, investment profile, and stated financial goals.
