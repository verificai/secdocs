Based on the information provided, there are several violations of the care obligation under section (2)(ii) of Regulation Best Interest:

1. **Violation of (2)(ii)(B) - Recommendations not in the customer's best interest based on their investment profile:**
   - The customer is 68 years old, retired, with moderate risk tolerance, yet was recommended "GWG L Bonds" with a "high" risk profile.
   - The customer's financial goal is "Retirement" which typically requires capital preservation and income, not high-risk investments.
   - The total investment in GWG L Bonds ($160,000) represents approximately 46% of the customer's total investment portfolio ($350,000), which is an excessive concentration in a high-risk product for someone with moderate risk tolerance.

2. **Violation of (2)(ii)(C) - Series of transactions that are excessive:**
   - The broker recommended five separate purchases of the same high-risk product (GWG L Bonds) over a 13-month period.
   - This series of transactions created an over-concentration in a single high-risk product across multiple account types (IRA, Individual, and Joint accounts).
   - The pattern of repeated recommendations for the same high-risk product suggests a failure to consider the cumulative risk to the client's overall portfolio.

3. **Violation of (2)(ii)(A) - Lack of reasonable basis:**
   - The broker failed to ensure that high-risk GWG L Bonds could be suitable for a 68-year-old retired investor with moderate risk tolerance and retirement goals.
   - The allocation shown indicates a much more conservative portfolio strategy (mostly low to moderate risk investments) which contradicts the high-risk GWG L Bond transactions, suggesting the broker didn't properly understand or consider how these high-risk bonds would fit within the client's investment profile.

These violations demonstrate that the broker failed to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill in making recommendations that aligned with this retired customer's investment profile, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
