# Violations under Section (2)(ii) - Care Obligation

Several violations of the care obligation under ยง 240.15l-1(a)(2)(ii) occurred:

## 1. Violation of ยง 240.15l-1(a)(2)(ii)(B) - Reasonable Basis for Recommendations

The broker failed to have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendations were in the best interest of this particular customer based on their investment profile because:

- While the customer has an "Aggressive" risk tolerance, the portfolio is **excessively concentrated in very high-risk investments** (75% in high or very high-risk products).
- The customer's financial goal is "Wealth Growth," but the portfolio is almost entirely focused on speculation rather than providing a balanced approach to sustainable wealth growth.
- With a $350K mortgage and family members to support, committing $400K (over 42% of their net worth) to predominantly speculative investments creates significant financial vulnerability.

## 2. Violation of ยง 240.15l-1(a)(2)(ii)(C) - Excessive Trading

The series of transactions shows potential excessive trading:

- The broker recommended 9 transactions within a 10-month period (Jan-Oct 2023)
- The transactions total $405,000 (several times their annual income of $180K)
- The customer initially had an investment portfolio of $400K and these transactions represent a complete turnover of the portfolio in less than a year
- The rapid sequence of high-value trades in speculative investments suggests excessive trading that prioritizes transaction fees over the customer's long-term best interest

These practices place the financial interests of the broker ahead of the retail customer, violating the fundamental principle of Regulation Best Interest's care obligation.
