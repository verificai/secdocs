# Regulation Best Interest: A Small Entity Compliance Guide[^1]

## Introduction

Regulation Best Interest establishes a "best interest" standard of conduct for broker-dealers and associated persons when they make a recommendation to a retail customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities, including recommendations of types of accounts.

As a broker-dealer, you must act in the best interest of the retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing your financial or other interest ahead of the interests of the retail customer.

## Regulation Best Interest includes four component obligations:

### 1. Disclosure Obligation

You must disclose material facts about the relationship and recommendations, including:
- That you are acting as a broker-dealer
- Material fees and costs the customer will pay
- Type and scope of services provided
- Conflicts of interest
- Whether you provide monitoring services

### 2. Care Obligation

You must exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making a recommendation to a retail customer. You must:
- Understand potential risks, rewards, and costs
- Have a reasonable basis to believe the recommendation is in the best interest of *some* retail customers
- Have a reasonable basis to believe the recommendation is in the best interest of *this particular* retail customer
- Have a reasonable basis to believe a series of recommendations, when viewed together, is not excessive

### 3. Conflict of Interest Obligation

You must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to:
- Identify and disclose, or eliminate, all conflicts of interest
- Identify and mitigate conflicts of interest that create an incentive to place your interest ahead of the retail customer
- Identify and disclose material limitations on offerings and associated conflicts
- Identify and eliminate sales contests, quotas, bonuses, and non-cash compensation based on the sale of specific securities or types of securities within a limited time period

### 4. Compliance Obligation

You must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Regulation Best Interest. This is an affirmative obligation with respect to the rule as a whole, and provides flexibility to allow you to establish compliance policies and procedures that accommodate your business model.

## Key Definitions

### Retail Customer
A natural person, or the legal representative of such natural person, who:
- Receives a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities from a broker-dealer
- Uses the recommendation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes

### Recommendation
The SEC interprets "recommendation" consistent with existing broker-dealer regulation under the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, and FINRA rules.

A recommendation:
- Is based on the facts and circumstances
- Is evaluated based on whether it reasonably could be viewed as a "call to action"
- Is analyzed through a facts and circumstances analysis, not through application of a bright line test
- Depends on the content, context, and presentation of the communication

## Recordkeeping Requirements

The SEC has amended existing recordkeeping requirements to:
- Require broker-dealers to retain records of all information collected from and provided to retail customers
- Conform the recordkeeping requirements to Regulation Best Interest
- Require records be retained for at least six years

## Compliance Date

The compliance date for Regulation Best Interest is June 30, 2020.
