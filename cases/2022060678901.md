# FINRA's First Regulation Best Interest Enforcement Case - Charles Malico

## Case Identification
This case represents FINRA's first enforcement action related to Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI).

**Case Number**: 2022060678901
**Respondent**: Charles Vincent Malico (CRD #1507282)
**Firm**: Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc.
**Date**: September 2022

## Violations

Charles Malico was found to have willfully violated Rule 15l-1(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Regulation Best Interest) and FINRA Rule 2010 by recommending a series of excessive transactions in a retail customer's account that were not in the customer's best interest.

## Facts and Context

1. The case involved a 63-year-old customer who opened an account with Malico in October 2020, after Regulation Best Interest went into effect (June 30, 2020).

2. Malico made numerous recommendations to the customer that resulted in excessive trading in the account, including:
   - In-and-out trading
   - Short-term trading of long-term products
   - Excessive commissions and fees relative to account value

3. The trading activity generated an annualized cost-to-equity ratio of 158%, meaning the customer's account would have needed to appreciate by 158% just to break even after accounting for trading costs.

4. The customer suffered losses of more than $17,500 during the relevant period.

5. FINRA determined Malico's recommendations were excessive in light of the customer's investment profile and needs, and were made to generate trading commissions rather than serve the customer's best interests.

## Care Obligation Violations

Malico violated the "Care Obligation" component of Regulation Best Interest, which requires broker-dealers to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations to retail customers. Specifically:

1. He failed to use reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks and rewards of his recommendations.

2. He did not have a reasonable basis to believe his recommendations were in the customer's best interest.

3. The pattern of trading he recommended was objectively unsuitable given:
   - The high cost-to-equity ratio (158%)
   - The rapid in-and-out trading pattern
   - The customer's investment profile

## Sanctions

Malico agreed to:
- A six-month suspension from association with any FINRA member
- A $5,000 fine
- Pay restitution to the affected customer

## Significance

This case is particularly significant as it represents FINRA's first formal enforcement action under Regulation Best Interest. It demonstrates that:

1. FINRA will use Reg BI to address excessive trading (historically addressed under suitability rules)

2. Quantitative factors such as cost-to-equity ratios will be important in determining Reg BI violations related to excessive trading

3. FINRA is actively enforcing the "best interest" standard that requires brokers to place their customers' interests ahead of their own

The case establishes precedent for how FINRA will apply Regulation Best Interest in cases involving excessive trading and sets expectations for the industry regarding compliance with the relatively new rule.
