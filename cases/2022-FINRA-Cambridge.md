# Cambridge Investment Research - Regulation Best Interest Enforcement Case

## Case Identification
This case represents another early enforcement action related to Regulation Best Interest.

**Respondent**: Cambridge Investment Research
**Date**: November 2022
**Form**: FINRA Acceptance, Waiver & Consent (AWC)

## Violations

Cambridge Investment Research was found to have violated Regulation Best Interest's Disclosure Obligation by failing to provide required disclosures to retail customers prior to or at the time of recommendations.

## Facts and Context

1. After the June 30, 2020 implementation date of Regulation Best Interest, Cambridge Investment Research failed to deliver Form CRS to thousands of existing retail customers.

2. Form CRS (Customer/Client Relationship Summary) is a brief relationship summary that provides information about the firm, including:
   - The types of services offered
   - The fees, costs, conflicts of interest, and required standard of conduct
   - Whether the firm and its financial professionals have disciplinary history

3. The firm was required to deliver Form CRS to all existing retail customers by July 30, 2020, but failed to meet this deadline for a significant number of customers.

4. In addition, the firm failed to provide Form CRS to certain new retail customers before or at the time recommendations were made.

5. The firm's delivery tracking systems were inadequate to ensure compliance with the Form CRS delivery requirements.

## Disclosure Obligation Violations

Cambridge Investment Research violated the "Disclosure Obligation" component of Regulation Best Interest, which requires broker-dealers to provide certain disclosures to retail customers before or at the time of a recommendation. Specifically:

1. The firm failed to deliver Form CRS to thousands of existing retail customers by the July 30, 2020 deadline.

2. The firm failed to deliver Form CRS to certain new retail customers before or at the time recommendations were made.

3. The firm's systems and procedures for tracking Form CRS delivery were inadequate to ensure compliance with Regulation Best Interest requirements.

4. The firm failed to maintain sufficient evidence of Form CRS delivery to retail customers as required by the recordkeeping provisions associated with Regulation Best Interest.

## Sanctions

Cambridge Investment Research agreed to:
- A monetary fine
- Certify that it has completed remediation by delivering Form CRS to all affected customers
- Implement enhanced procedures for tracking Form CRS delivery

## Significance

This case is significant because:

1. It focuses specifically on the Form CRS delivery requirements, which are a key component of Regulation Best Interest's Disclosure Obligation.

2. It demonstrates FINRA's attention to procedural and technical compliance requirements, not just substantive recommendation practices.

3. It highlights the importance of implementing proper systems and procedures for tracking regulatory deliveries to customers.

4. It shows that FINRA is monitoring compliance across all aspects of Regulation Best Interest, including disclosure requirements.

5. It serves as a reminder that firms must maintain adequate evidence of compliance with Form CRS delivery requirements.

The case underscores that compliance with Regulation Best Interest involves not just proper recommendations, but also adherence to disclosure, recordkeeping, and procedural requirements designed to enhance retail customer protection.
