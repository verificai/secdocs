**Respondent**: Spartan Securities Group, Ltd.
**Date**: December 2022
**Form**: FINRA Acceptance, Waiver & Consent (AWC)

## Violations

Spartan Securities was found to have violated multiple obligations under Regulation Best Interest, including the Compliance Obligation, Disclosure Obligation, and Care Obligation.

## Facts and Context

1. After the June 30, 2020 implementation date of Regulation Best Interest, Spartan Securities failed to adequately update its policies, procedures, and practices to comply with the new regulation.

2. The firm made recommendations to retail customers regarding complex products, including leveraged and inverse ETFs, without conducting sufficient due diligence to understand the products' features and risks.

3. The firm failed to consider reasonable alternatives that might be in the best interest of retail customers when making recommendations.

4. Spartan did not provide adequate disclosures regarding material facts and conflicts of interest related to its recommendations.

5. The firm's registered representatives recommended complex products to retail customers without a reasonable basis to believe the recommendations were in those customers' best interests.

## Multiple Obligation Violations

Spartan Securities violated several components of Regulation Best Interest:

### Compliance Obligation Violations
1. Failed to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Regulation Best Interest
2. Continued to rely primarily on pre-Reg BI suitability-based procedures
3. Did not implement adequate supervisory systems to monitor compliance with Regulation Best Interest

### Disclosure Obligation Violations
1. Failed to provide required disclosures about material facts related to the scope and terms of the relationship
2. Did not disclose all material facts relating to conflicts of interest associated with recommendations
3. Failed to deliver Form CRS to certain retail customers by the required deadline

### Care Obligation Violations
1. Failed to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations of complex products
2. Did not have a reasonable basis to believe recommendations of leveraged and inverse ETFs were in customers' best interests
3. Failed to consider the potential risks, rewards, and costs of recommendations in light of customers' investment profiles

## Sanctions

Spartan Securities agreed to:
- A significant monetary fine
- Undertake a comprehensive review and revision of its policies and procedures
- Implement enhanced training for all registered representatives
- Conduct a lookback review to identify and remediate potential customer harm

## Significance

This case is significant because:

1. It demonstrates FINRA's willingness to pursue violations across multiple obligations of Regulation Best Interest in a single enforcement action.

2. It focuses on complex products like leveraged and inverse ETFs, which have been a regulatory priority due to their potential risks for retail investors.

3. It highlights the enhanced due diligence requirements for recommendations of complex products under Regulation Best Interest.

4. It emphasizes that firms must consider reasonable available alternatives when making recommendations to retail customers.

5. It shows that firms cannot simply rebrand their suitability procedures as Regulation Best Interest procedures without substantive changes.

The case serves as an important reminder that Regulation Best Interest imposes heightened obligations across multiple dimensions of the broker-dealer/customer relationship, requiring comprehensive compliance programs that address each component of the regulation.
