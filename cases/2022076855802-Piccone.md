# Analysis of FINRA AWC No. 2022076855802 - Angelo J. Piccone

## Case Identification
**Case Number**: 2022076855802
**Respondent**: Angelo J. Piccone (CRD No. 1401761)
**Firm**: IBN Financial Services, Inc. (CRD No. 42360)
**Date**: January 29, 2025 (Acceptance Date)

## Violations

Angelo J. Piccone was found to have willfully violated Rule 15l-1(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Regulation Best Interest or "Reg BI") and FINRA Rule 2010 by recommending unsuitable investments to a retail customer. Additionally, Piccone violated FINRA Rules 4511, 2210(d), and 2010 related to unapproved communications and misleading statements.

## Facts and Context

1. Between November 2020 and February 2021, Piccone recommended that a retail customer invest 77% of her net worth (excluding primary residence) in speculative alternative investments.

2. The customer had the following investment profile:
   - Moderate risk tolerance
   - Annual income of no more than $25,000
   - Net worth (excluding primary residence) of $587,438
   - Investment objectives: preservation of capital, current income, and funding retirement (not speculation)

3. Piccone recommended 11 sales of speculative, illiquid alternative investments totaling $457,000, including two sales of GWG L Bonds totaling $90,000.

4. GWG Holdings, Inc. was a financial services company that:
   - Had a history of net losses
   - Had not generated sufficient operating and investing cash flows to fund its operations
   - Offered unrated corporate bonds (L Bonds) to finance operations
   - Eventually defaulted on its obligations to L Bond investors in January 2022 and filed for bankruptcy in April 2022

5. The L Bonds were described in offering documents as speculative, involving a high degree of risk, illiquid, and only suitable for persons with substantial financial resources and no need for liquidity.

6. Piccone earned $23,905.81 in commissions from his recommendations of these alternative investments.

7. Additionally, between April 2021 and June 2022, Piccone used his personal mobile device to exchange text messages with the customer about securities business, violating firm policies and recordkeeping requirements.

8. In April 2022, Piccone sent a text message to the customer stating that when GWG was sold "we will get your money back," which was an unbalanced, promissory, and misleading statement.

9. The customer eventually brought and settled an arbitration claim against IBN relating to her GWG investments.

## Care Obligation Violations

Piccone violated the "Care Obligation" component of Regulation Best Interest, which requires broker-dealers and associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations to retail customers. Specifically:

1. Piccone's recommendations resulted in the customer becoming 77% concentrated in alternative investments, including a 15% concentration in L Bonds, which was inconsistent with her moderate risk tolerance and stated investment objectives.

2. The customer's investment profile clearly indicated preservation of capital and current income as objectives, not speculation, yet Piccone recommended highly speculative investments.

3. Piccone failed to properly consider the customer's financial situation—a person with an annual income of no more than $25,000 and modest net worth—before recommending investments in products specifically designated for persons with "substantial financial resources."

4. The concentration level (77% in speculative alternatives) created a risk of loss inconsistent with the customer's investment profile and moderate risk tolerance.

5. The illiquid nature of the investments was unsuitable given the customer's retirement funding objective, which typically requires some liquidity for income needs.

## Communications Violations

Piccone also violated FINRA Rules related to communications with the public and recordkeeping:

1. By using his personal mobile device for securities business communications, Piccone caused IBN to fail to comply with its recordkeeping obligations under Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4).

2. Piccone's April 2022 text message about GWG violated FINRA Rule 2210(d) because it:
   - Was not fair and balanced
   - Did not provide a sound basis for evaluating GWG's status
   - Made only positive claims about recovery prospects without addressing potential loss
   - Was promissory and misleading in guaranteeing the customer would recover her money

## Sanctions

Piccone agreed to:

1. A five-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all capacities
2. A $10,000 fine
3. Disgorgement of $23,905.81 in commissions plus interest from February 10, 2021, until the date of AWC acceptance

Additionally, Piccone became subject to statutory disqualification as a result of his willful violation of Exchange Act Rule 15l-1.

## Significance

This case is significant because:

1. It demonstrates FINRA's focus on concentration risk as a key factor in Regulation Best Interest enforcement actions, even when the individual investment products might be suitable for some investors.

2. It emphasizes that recommendations must align with all aspects of a customer's investment profile, particularly risk tolerance and investment objectives.

3. It highlights the heightened scrutiny of recommendations involving speculative products like L Bonds, particularly when marketing them to retail investors with modest financial resources.

4. It shows FINRA's ongoing concern with recordkeeping violations related to unapproved communication channels, including personal text messages.

5. It serves as a reminder that communications with customers, even informal text messages, must remain balanced and not make promissory statements, especially when investments are at risk.

The case reinforces that Regulation Best Interest requires a holistic view of suitability that considers the customer's entire financial situation and the impact of recommended transactions on their overall portfolio.
