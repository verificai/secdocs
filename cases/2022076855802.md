## Facts and Context

1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Form CRS requirements as part of Regulation Best Interest, with the compliance date of June 30, 2020.

5. The firm's delivery tracking systems were inadequate to ensure compliance with the Form CRS delivery requirements, and it lacked proper supervisory procedures to monitor and verify Form CRS delivery.

## Disclosure Obligation Violations

Allstate Financial Services violated the "Disclosure Obligation" component of Regulation Best Interest, which requires broker-dealers to provide certain disclosures to retail customers. Specifically:

1. The firm failed to deliver Form CRS to thousands of existing retail customers by the July 30, 2020 deadline.

2. The firm failed to deliver Form CRS to numerous new retail customers before or at the time of opening accounts.

3. Form CRS is a critical disclosure document that provides retail investors with important information about:
   - The types of services offered
   - The fees, costs, conflicts of interest, and required standard of conduct
   - Whether the firm and its financial professionals have disciplinary history

4. By failing to deliver Form CRS in a timely manner, Allstate Financial Services deprived retail customers of important information needed to make informed decisions about their investment relationships.

1. The firm failed to implement adequate systems to track and verify Form CRS delivery to existing and new retail customers.

2. The firm's written supervisory procedures did not clearly designate responsibility for ensuring Form CRS delivery compliance.

3. The firm lacked proper monitoring systems to identify instances where Form CRS was not delivered as required.

4. The firm did not conduct adequate reviews to test compliance with Form CRS delivery requirements.

## Sanctions

Allstate Financial Services agreed to:
- A monetary fine of approximately $115,000
- Certify that it has completed remediation by delivering Form CRS to all affected customers
- Implement enhanced procedures for tracking Form CRS delivery
- Review and revise its supervisory systems and procedures related to Form CRS delivery

## Significance

This case is significant because:

1. It reflects FINRA's focus on enforcing the disclosure aspects of Regulation Best Interest, even when no customer harm has been demonstrated.

2. It highlights the importance of implementing proper systems and procedures for tracking regulatory document deliveries to customers.

3. It demonstrates FINRA's expectation that firms will have robust supervisory systems in place to monitor compliance with all aspects of Regulation Best Interest.

4. It serves as a reminder that firms must maintain adequate evidence of compliance with Form CRS delivery requirements.

5. It shows that technical violations of disclosure requirements can result in significant penalties, even in the absence of fraud or customer complaints.

The case underscores that compliance with Regulation Best Interest involves not just proper recommendations, but also adherence to disclosure, recordkeeping, and procedural requirements designed to enhance retail customer protection.
