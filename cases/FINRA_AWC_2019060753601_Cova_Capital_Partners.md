# Analysis of FINRA AWC No. 2019060753601 - Cova Capital Partners LLC

## Violations of Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii) - The "Care Obligation"

This analysis examines the violations by Cova Capital Partners LLC related to the Care Obligation under Regulation Best Interest as detailed in FINRA's Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) No. 2019060753601.

### Care Obligation Requirements (As Defined in the Document):
- Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(ii) requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to "exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill" to understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with a recommendation
- The document notes that "reasonable diligence" depends on the complexity of and risks associated with the recommended security
- Broker-dealers must have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation could be in the best interest of at least some retail investors

### Specific Care Obligation Violations by Cova:

1. **Offering 1 (Pre-IPO Shares of Company A) - June 2018 to February 2020**:
   - Failed to verify whether Issuer 1 actually possessed or had rights to the shares of Company A
   - Did not investigate the markups applied by Issuer 1 to the shares, despite knowing markups were being charged
   - These failures meant Cova had "no reasonable basis to believe that Issuer 1 had access to or possession of the pre-IPO shares identified in the offering documents, or that Issuer 1's markups were reasonable and properly disclosed"
   - Sold over $2 million of these securities to nine investors
   - Later developments: The SEC filed a lawsuit against Issuer 1 in May 2022 alleging fraud through undisclosed, excessive markups and insufficient pre-IPO shares, and criminal charges followed in November 2023

2. **Offering 2 (October 2019 to 2021)**:
   - Failed to exercise reasonable diligence regarding Issuer 2's management
   - Did not identify that Issuer 2's Chief Executive Officer was previously the subject of federal and state regulatory actions related to illegal robocalls targeting senior consumers
   - This background information would have been material to assessing the risks of the investment
   - Sold over $1.7 million to 24 investors

3. **Offering 3 (Pre-IPO Shares of Company B) - September to December 2021**:
   - Failed to verify Issuer 3's ownership of or rights to Company B shares
   - Ignored information concerning SEC charges filed against two individuals associated with another pre-IPO fund from which Issuer 3 purported to source Company B shares
   - The failure to investigate these red flags violated the reasonable diligence requirement
   - Sold over $9 million to 49 investors

### Regulatory Context and Significance:

The violations spanned a period that included both pre-Regulation Best Interest (before June 30, 2020) and post-Regulation Best Interest implementation. For conduct before June 30, 2020, FINRA Rule 2111 (Suitability) was the applicable standard, while Rule 15l-1 (Regulation Best Interest) applied after that date.

Notably, FINRA explicitly referenced Regulatory Notice 10-22, which reminded firms of their obligation to conduct reasonable investigations of issuers and securities recommended in connection with private placements. The document also mentioned Regulatory Notice 23-08, which updates and supplements the guidance in Regulatory Notice 10-22.

### The Document's Direct Statement on Care Obligation Violation:

The document specifically states that "By recommending to its customers three private offerings without conducting due diligence sufficient to form a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendations were suitable for and in the best interest of at least some investors, Cova willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 15l-1(a)(1) and violated FINRA Rules 2111 and 2010."

While the AWC cites the overall Reg BI violation as 15l-1(a)(1), the substantive description of the violations specifically addresses failures under the Care Obligation [15l-1(a)(2)(ii)]. The failures to conduct adequate due diligence, investigate red flags, and understand the fundamental attributes of the investments all demonstrate that Cova did not exercise the "reasonable diligence, care, and skill" required by the Care Obligation.

### Supervisory Systems Failures:

The AWC also identified related violations of Reg BI's Compliance Obligation [Rule 15l-1(a)(2)(iv)] because Cova failed to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI. Specifically:

- Cova's written procedures merely recited general obligations without describing what documents and information should be collected as part of the investigation
- The procedures failed to identify individuals responsible for conducting, documenting, and reviewing the due diligence process
- The procedures listed some due diligence steps that were never actually carried out in practice

### Consequences:
- $30,000 fine
- Censure
- Implementation of proper supervisory systems and procedures within 60 days
- Statutory disqualification from FINRA membership due to the willful violation

### Impact on Investors:
The case highlights how the firm's failures put retail investors at significant risk by:
1. Recommending private placements without confirming the issuers had legitimate access to the securities being sold
2. Not investigating the backgrounds of issuer management teams
3. Ignoring red flags that could have protected investors from potentially fraudulent offerings
4. Not determining if markups charged to investors were reasonable or properly disclosed

### Key Takeaways:
1. Broker-dealers must conduct reasonable due diligence that is appropriate to the complexity and risks of the investment
2. Private placement due diligence should focus on verification of fundamental aspects like ownership of assets being sold
3. Background checks on issuers' management are essential components of reasonable due diligence
4. Ignoring red flags that emerge during due diligence can constitute a violation of the Care Obligation
5. Written supervisory procedures must provide specific, actionable guidance for conducting due diligence
